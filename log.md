# Log

ashah282 @ 11/27/23: Attempting to partition visits however error in CSV conversion (year=2020). Also error in procedure-dates folder as not run, will update.

ashah282 @ 11/24/23: Clinical data split for all data sources except Notes. From 2010 to July 2023 (refresh 2). Issue with Notes due to file size (?). Errored on array ID 5-14. Trial again with higher CPU available?
