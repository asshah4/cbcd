At JBVA given symtpoms of pronounced LE weakness after diarrheal episode, concern for GBS and pt was transfered to UIC -Neuro ICU service.     FINDINGS : MRI L SPINE WWO: Alignment of lumbar spine and vertebral height are normally maintained with anatomical lordotic curvature. There are an 1 cm sized Schmorl's node in the inferior endplate of L4 that shows delayed contrast enhancement, and a focally increased contrast enhancement of the subchondral marrow posteriorly, likely representing vascularized granulation. The spinal canal is capacious. No evidence of nerve root impingement is seen at any visualized levels.   Intervertebral discs at the individual levels: T11-T12: Unremarkable. T12-L1: Unremarkable. L1-L2: Unremarkable. L2-L3: Mild disc bulge. L3-L4: Mild disc bulge. L4-L5: Disc space narrowing on the right side. Diffuse disc bulge eccentric to the right subarticular region with mild right neural foraminal stenosis. L5-S1: Mild facet hypertrophy on the right.  IMPRESSION: 1. No abnormal intraspinal contrast enhancement. 2. No evidence of herniated disc, spinal canal stenosis or nerve root impingement. 3. A large Schmorl's node at the inferior L4 and L4-L5 degenerative disc.

CT L spine to evaluate for ossesous abnormalities. Final read still pending at time of discharge. On exam pt had regained strength in his LLE and was noted to have 1+  achilles reflexes bilaterally.  Able to ambulate wo difficulty. Unable to tandem, but states this is his baseline. Squats wo difficulty.  Overall clinical picture inconsistent with Gullian Barre. MRI wo structural lesions to explain sx; furthermore expect structural lesions to have static neurological findings.  Suspect pt had a viral myositis given recent infection  and elevated CK, which gradually improved.  Returned to baseline no indication for PT/OT. Okay to discharge home.  Should follow up w his PCP at the VA in 1 week. Continue outpt medication regimen, no changes made.  Advised to return to ED if symptoms return.

Patient's symptoms had been slowly improving from Wednesday-Sunday and on my intiial examination patient has normal motor strength with preserved ankle reflexes and chronic stocking-glove sensory loss. MRI L-spine negative. Labs reveal mild elevation in CK. Given recent viral prodrome and transient symptoms of muscle weakness and cramps the patient's diagnosis is most consistent with a viral myositis. I discussed options of observation in hospital x1-more day or discharge home with plan to return to ER if symptoms worsened and patient decided he wanted to go home. I have advised him to take 1-week off of work and we will provide documentation to miss work. The patient can follow up routinely with his PCP and he is encouraged to return to ER if his weakness returns. I personally saw the patient, reviewed all imaging, reviewed all medications, and all labs.   Baback Arshi, MD Neurocritical Care"

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  End-stage renal disease.  PROCEDURES:  Right axillary-axillary AV loop graft placement.  SURGEON:  Taylor D. Hicks, M.D.  RESIDENT:  Daniel Moreira, M.D.  ANESTHESIA:  General.  ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  20 mL.  SPECIMEN:  None.  COMPLICATIONS:  None.  INDICATIONS:  Ms. Vesey has a history of end-stage renal disease and was in need of permanent AV access.  She was therefore brought to the operating room for graft placement.  PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  After informed consent was obtained, she was brought to the operating room, placed in supine position on the operating table.  IV antibiotics were administered and general anesthesia was induced.  The right arm was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A longitudinal incision was made over the medial proximal arm near the axilla.  Dissection was carried through the subcutaneous tissue down to the axillary vein.  It appeared of adequate size and quality to use as outflow for an AV graft.  It was dissected circumferentially, controlled with vessel.  We continued our dissection a little more deeply and identified the axillary artery.  It was dissected circumferentially for a length adequate to perform an anastomosis to control with a vessel loop.  I made a counterincision in the antecubital fossa and then created a subcutaneous tunnel between the incisions.  A 4-7 mm tapered PTFE graft was then pulled through the tunnel, taking care to ensure that no twisting took place during this process.  The patient was systemically heparinized.  After allowing sufficient time for the heparin to circulate, clamps were applied to the axillary artery.  Arteriotomy was made with a 15- blade and extended with Potts scissors.  The 4 mm end of the graft was spatulated and anastomosed to the artery in an end-to-side fashion with a running 6-0 Prolene suture.  Once this anastomosis was complete, the artery was flushed through the graft.  The clamp was then applied to the graft. Clamps were applied to the axillary vein.  A venotomy was made with an 11- blade and extended with Potts scissors.  The 7 mm end of the graft was spatulated, anastomosed the vein in end-to-side fashion with a running 6-0 Prolene suture.  Prior to completing the anastomosis, we allowed the vein to backbleed and flush the graft in 4 directions once again.  Once complete, the clamps were removed.  This resulted in excellent throw within the graft.  Once we achieved hemostasis, subcutaneous tissue was closed and both wounds with running 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was closed with 4-0 Monocryl sutures placed in subcuticular fashion.  Dermabond was applied to the wound. Anesthesia was reversed.  She was taken to recovery room in good condition. All needle, sponge, and instrument counts were reported to be correct at the end of the case.  I was present for the entire case.

She states that since the procedure she has noticed some numbness over her 4th and 5th digits in the right hand.  Additionally, she states that her grip strength has decreased.  She otherwise denies any complaints. Pt current receives HD via a LIJ tunneled permacath.  Pt is s/p fistulagram 3/6/19, with the findings described below:  ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:  The AV graft was patent from the arterial anastomosis through the venous anastomosis.  The axillary vein, subclavian vein, innominate vein, and superior vena cava were all widely patent without significant stenosis.  The innominate artery, right subclavian artery, and right axillary artery were all patent without significant stenosis.  The brachial artery distal to the anastomosis of the graft was patent, but was diminutive in size. Additionally, we observed reflux from the more distal artery back into the AV graft, consistent with steal syndrome.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Malfunctioning right arm arteriovenous graft with steal syndrome.  PROCEDURES:  Ligation of right arm arteriovenous graft with graft excision.  SURGEON:  Taylor D Hicks, MD.  RESIDENT:  Dr. Raven Jones.  ANESTHESIA:  Regional.  ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  10 mL.  SPECIMEN:  None.  COMPLICATIONS:  None.  INDICATION:  Ms. Vesey has a history of end-stage renal disease and had a right axillary-axillary AV loop graft placed for hemodialysis access.  She subsequently developed significant steal syndrome with motor weakness in her right hand.  An angiogram was performed that demonstrated no significant inflow stenosis.  Given her severe deficit, the decision was made to take her to the operating room for ligation of the graft in order to regain function in her right hand.  PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  After informed consent was obtained, she was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position upon the table.  Right upper extremity block was performed by the Anesthesia Service.  IV antibiotics were administered.  She was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Her axillary incision was reopened.  Dissection was carried through the subcutaneous tissue using electrocautery down to the arterial limb of the graft.  We traced the arterial limb of the graft down to the anastomosis to the axillary artery.  The graft was dissected circumferentially and controlled with a vessel loop.  We then turned our attention to the venous limb of the graft.  We identified the venous limb of the graft.  It was dissected circumferentially and traced down to its anastomosis to the axillary vein. The vein proximal and distal to the anastomosis was then dissected circumferentially.  A clamp was placed at the level of the arterial anastomosis.  A second clamp was placed on the graft.  The graft was then transected, leaving a small cuff of graft on the artery.  This cuff was oversewn with a 5-0 Prolene suture. Once complete, the clamp was removed.  Next, we applied clamps to the axillary vein.  The venous anastomosis was then taken down sharply using an 11 blade. The vein was repaired with a running 5-0 Prolene suture.  Once complete, the clamps were removed.  We then removed the remainder of the graft by pulling it through the tunnel.  It was delivered from the field.  We then checked the patient's radial pulse, which was now palpable once again.  Once we achieved hemostasis, the subcutaneous tissue was closed in multiple layers with 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was closed with a 3-0 nylon suture.  Sterile dressing was applied.  She was taken to Day Surgery in good condition.  All needle, sponge, and instrument counts were reported to be correct at the end of the case.  I was present for the entire case.

AFib 3.  CAD sp PCI  POSTPROCEDURE DIAGNOSES: 1.  Severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. 2.  Successful deployment of a 29 mm CoreValve Evolut Pro valve in the aortic position via right transfemoral access.  PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1.  General Anesthesia by Anesthesiology. 2.  Bilateral iliofemoral angiography. 3.  Transvenous pacemaker insertion and removal. 4.  Left heart catheterization with simultaneous left ventricular and aortic pressures. 5.  Ascending aortography. 6.  Insertion and removal of an 16 F Cook sheath via the right femoral access with 2 Perclose sutures deployed in a preclose fashion. 7.  Successful deployment of a 29 mm CoreValve Evolut Pro valve in the aortic position. 8.  Balloon aortic valuloplasty with a 22 mm Z-Med balloon. 9.  Mynx vascular closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site.  INDICATIONS: Mrs Daizella Vesey is an extremely pleasant 80 yo woman with severe aortic stenosis who presented with dyspnea and heart failure and was found to have severe aortic stenosis. She was felt to be a high risk candidate for surgical aortic valve replacement and presented for TAVR.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: After discussion of the risks, benefits, and alternatives, the patient signed informed consent.  The patient was brought to the hybrid operating suite in a stable, fasting and nonsedated state.  He was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion and placed under conscious sedation by Anesthesiology.  1% lidocaine solution was used for local anesthesia and a 6-French pinnacle sheath was placed in the left femoral artery using a modified Seldinger technique. A 7-French pinnacle sheath was then placed in the left femoral vein using a modified Seldinger technique.  A left iliofemoral angiogram was performed in the LAO projection. Through the, femoral venous sheath, we advanced a transvenous pacer into the right ventricle and confirmed adequate pacing capture.  We then advanced a 5-French rim catheter with a Glidewire through the left femoral arterial sheath, and advanced it into the right external iliac artery.  A direct anterior puncture of the right femoral artery was performed using fluoroscopy and direct visualization with contrast injection through the rim catheter.  Two Perclose suture devices were deployed in a preclose fashion.  We serially dilated the arteriotomy site with a 12-French dilator followed by a 14-French then over the wire, advanced a 16-French Cook sheath.    We advanced a 6-French pigtail catheter through the left femoral arterial sheath into the ascending aorta and performed ascending aortography to confirm optimal deployment angles. Through the right femoral arterial sheath, we advanced an AL1 diagnostic catheter over a J wire and then exchanged for a straight wire, which we used to cross the aortic valve.  The AL1 diagnostic catheter was advanced into the left ventricle and the wire was exchanged for an exchange length J wire, which was advanced to the apex.  The AL1 was removed from the body, and an angled pigtail catheter was advanced over this wire into the left ventricle to obtain simultaneous left ventricular and aortic pressures.  A Confida wire was then advanced through the left ventricular pigtail catheter and we removed the pigtail catheter.  We then removed the Cook sheath and inserted the 29 mm CoreValve Evolut R valve using the in line sheath and passed it into the descending thoracic aorta.  The valve was advanced across the aortic arch across and then the aortic annulus.  We successfully deployed the 29 mm CoreValve Evolut Pro valve.    The valve delivery system was then removed followed by reinsertion of the Cook sheath and passage of the pigtail catheter into the left ventricle. Simultaneous left ventricular and aortic pressures showed no residual gradient, however, there was some aortic insufficiency, and thus a 22mm Z-Med balloon was used for post dilation. Final ascending aortography showed no significant aortic insufficiency.  The pigtail catheter was then removed, followed by removal of the Cook sheath, with deployment of the Perclose suture devices.  The left femoral arteriotomy was then closed using a Mnyx device.  Protamine was administered to reverse the ACT and the temp wire was removed.  The procedure was tolerated well without complications and heparin was used for anticoagulation during the case and verified with ACT measurements.  DISCUSSION: Mrs Daizella Vesey is an extremely pleasant 80 yo woman with severe aortic stenosis who presented with dyspnea and heart failure and was found to have severe aortic stenosis. She was felt to be a high risk candidate for surgical aortic valve replacement and presented for TAVR. Successful right transfemoral TAVR was performed today with implantation of a 29 mm CoreValve Evolut Pro valve.  The patient was transferred for the ICU for post-procedure care.  PLAN: 1.  We will complete access site precautions and monitor in the Intensive Care Unit. 2.  Restart Eliquis in the AM on POD#1. 3.  Monitor on telemetry and consider permanent pacemaker device implantation depending on conduction system disease observed overnight. 4.  Plan for transthoracic echocardiography to evaluate the aortic valve tomorrow. 5.  He should follow up with Dr. Groves  within 4 weeks with outpatient TTE.  Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of your patient. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us."

General Anesthesia by Anesthesiology. 2.  Bilateral iliofemoral angiography. 3.  Transvenous pacemaker insertion and removal. 4.  Left heart catheterization with simultaneous left ventricular and aortic pressures. 5.  Ascending aortography. 6.  Insertion and removal of an 16 F Cook sheath via the right femoral access with 2 Perclose sutures deployed in a preclose fashion. 7.

Mynx vascular closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site.  TTE 5/25/2018 CONCLUSIONS:  1. Due to technical issues, the quality of the study was limited.  2. Normal left ventricular function.  3. LV ejection fraction is visually estimated to be 65 to 70%.  4. Moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy.  5. A bioprosthetic valve (TAVR) is present in the aortic position. It is not Well seen. Suggestion of mild insufficiency but origin (perivalvular vs transvalvular is difficult to determine.) V max 1.5 m/sec. DI 0.8.  6. A late peaking velocity is noted in the LVOT Vmax 3.06 m/sec which would be c/w dynamic LVOT obstruction with a peak gradient of approx 37 mm hg.  7. PA systolic pressure not assessed due to an inadequate degree of tricuspid insufficiency.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Vesey is an 80 y/o female with PMHx hypotension on midodrine, CAD s/p PCI with multiple DES to LAD/LCx, mod-severe AS, COPD/asthma on 2-3L home O2, ESRD on HD T Th S, Afib on eliquis, gout presents from nursing home for scheduled TAVR on 5/24/18. Patient originally presented to ED on 2/13/18 for evaluation of her left arm fistula not working. Patient had been referred to UIC from St. Anthony's to have cath procedure done as outpatient, however given the failure of her fistula she was told to come to UIC on 2/13 to obtain pre-op clearance prior to having new access placement. The patient was admitted and underwent LHC on 2/14/18 which showed multi-vessel disease along with moderate-severe aortic stenosis. CT Surgery was consulted for evaluation for CABG. Work up for CABG was initiated; however given the patient's age, and co-morbidities, she elected to undergo staged PCI instead. A temporary dialysis catheter was placed by IR for HD access. She subsequently underwent successful PCI of the distal left main and LAD on 2/19/18 with potential for further PCI and possible aortic valve repair. She was restarted on warfarin for her Afib and on ticagrelor (ticagrelor chosen because of unfavorable clopidogrel genomics) for 6months with plans to transition from ticagrelor to ASA 81 afterwards. Patient was discharged to nursing home for rehab where she has remained stable. Per patient, she was switched from warfarin to eliquis ~1 month ago due to difficulty controlling INR (supratherapeutic). She elected to have scheduled TAVR on 5/24/18 to address her aortic stenosis--mean AV gradient of 25.9 mmHg, peak AV velocity of 3.25 m/s and valve area of 1.16 cmÂ¿.

I discussed the management with the residents and  Cardiology Fellow.  I agree with the documented findings and plan of care with corrections noted below about TTE findings:  Pt doing well s/p TAVR on 5/24/2018; no post-procedural issues except for some N/V this AM.   TTE from 5/25/2018 reviewed shows normal functioning TAVR with perhaps mild-mod PVL though not well seen; there is a late peaking mid-cavitary LV gradient that is due to a hyperdynamic LV with end-cavity obliteration and not a dynamic LVOT velocity (no SAM seen). No dynamic murmur heard on exam on AM of discharge.  Pt to follow up in Valve clinic for follow up.    M. Kansal Cardiology Attending

I reviewed the echo and angiogram findings myself please obtain carotid ultrasound and GSV vein mapping ultrasound as well as PFTs to assess the lung functions and breathing capacity . if the workup is completed and the patien is agreable I would recommend CABG and aortic valve assessment for possible AVR early next week.

Pt was initially supposed to be referred to UIC for cardiac workup prior to undergoing new fistula placement, but given her fistula stopped working at HD session on 2/13, she was instructed to come through our ED.  She was admitted to Cardiology after having elevated troponins (0.09) in the ED.  TTE was obtained on 2/14 showing LVEF 55-60% with moderate aortic stenosis (mean gradient 25.9mmHg, Vmax 3.25 m/s, and valve area of 1.16cm2. She was then sent for LHC which was completed on same day 2/14, which demonstrated multi vessel disease-->70% distal L main lesion, LAD with 60% mid stenosis, and LCx with ostial 60% lesion.  Given L main disease and moderate aortic stenosis, CT Surgery was consulted for CABG and AVR evaluation.

Daniel Feldman, MD 2.  Mohammed Al-Yafi, MD  PREPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: 1.  Coronary artery disease 2.  Severe distal left main disease 3.  Severe proximal to mid LAD disease  POST PROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: 1.  Successful PCI to the distal left main bifurcation 2.  Successful PCI to the proximal LAD 3.  Successful PCI to the mid LAD  PROCEDURES PERFORMED:   1.  Selective coronary angiography  2.  Intravascular ultrasound interrogation of the left main, LAD and LCx 3.  Successful PCI to the distal left main bifurcation using a culotte technique with a 3.5x26mm Resolute Onyx stent into the LCx and a 3.5x22mm Resolute Onyx into the LAD post dilated with a 4.5mm NC in the left main 4.  Successful PCI to the proximal LAD with a 3.5x34mm Resolute Onyx 5.  Successful PCI to the mid LAD with a 3x18mm Resolute Onyx 6.  Ileofemoral angiography  CLINICAL HISTORY:  Mrs Diazella Vesey is a very pleasant 80yo woman with multivessel CAD, COPD, AS, ESRD and AFib who presented with unstable angina. She was found to have distal left main coronary artery disease and moderate to severe AS. Her STS score was 17-18% risk of mortality with an open procedure, thus she elected a percutaneous approach.  PREMEDICATIONS:  Benadryl 50 mg PO on call, Valium 5 mg PO on call  CONSCIOUS SEDATION:  Versed 1mg and Fentanyl 25mcg were given under the direction of the primary operator in conjunction with the nurse in the case monitoring the patient. Doses were titrated to effect to achieve adequate levels of moderate sedation. A total of 90 minutes of monitoring were required.  APPROACH:  The procedure was performed via left femoral artery access.  COMPLICATIONS:  None.  Patient tolerated the procedure well.  No access site hematoma was present and distal pulses were intact.  The patient left the Catheterization Lab in stable condition.  HEMODYNAMIC DATA:  Aortic pressure (mmHg):  128/50  PROCEDURAL MEDICATIONS     Total units Heparin given:  18000     Intracoronary NTG:  200  Other:  None  VESSEL DILATED:  Mid LAD SUPPLIES UTILIZED:       Guiding Catheter:  7F XB 3.5     Guide Wire:  Sion Blue     Balloon Dilatation Catheter:  None     Stent:  3x18mm Resolute Onyx PROCEDURAL COMMENTS:  After access was obtained a ileofemoral angiogram demonstrated no bleeding and a CFA puncture. A 7F XB 3.5 guide was engaged in the LM. Sion blue wires were passed into the distal LAD and distal LCx. IVUS images were obtained which demonstrated a 4.5mm proximal LAD, distal LM MLA of <6mm2 and ostial LCx and LAD disease. Mid LAD is then directly stented with a 3x18mm Resolute Onyx.  VESSEL DILATED:  Proximal LAD SUPPLIES UTILIZED:       Guiding Catheter:  7F XB 3.5     Guide Wire:  Sion Blue     Balloon Dilatation Catheter:  3x20mm NC Euphora     Stent:  3.5x34mm Resolute Onyx PROCEDURAL COMMENTS:  A 3x20mm NC Euphora was then used to predilate the proximal LAD and the vessel was stented with a 3.5x34mm Resolute Onyx.  VESSEL DILATED:  Distal left main into LCx and LAD SUPPLIES UTILIZED:       Guiding Catheter:  7F XB 3.5     Guide Wire:  Sion Blue     Balloon Dilatation Catheter:  4.5x12mm NC Euphora, 3.5x15mm NC Euphora x2     Stent:  Culotte technique with a 3.5x26mm Resolute Onyx stent into the LCx and a 3.5x22mm Resolute Onyx into the LAD PROCEDURAL COMMENTS:  Attention was turned to the LM bifurcation. A 3.5x26mm Resolute Onyx was placed from the LM into the proximal LCx. The LM portion of the stent was then treated with a 4.5x12mm NC Euphora for proximal optimization (POT). The wire in the LCx was passed into the LAD the stent struts were opened with a 3x30mm NC Euphora and a 3.5x22mm Resolute Onyx was placed from the LM into the LAD. Re-POT was then performed. Kissing inflation was then completed with two 3.5x15mm NC Euphora balloons. All wires were then removed. After infusion of intracoronary nitroglycerin, final angiography demonstrated TIMI 3 flow, no dissections, no perforations and 0% residual stenosis.  MANUAL HOLD/CLOSURE DEVICE/SHEATHS IN PLACE:  Perclose  CONCLUSIONS: 1.  Successful PCI to the distal left main bifurcation 2.  Successful PCI to the proximal LAD 3.  Successful PCI to the mid LAD  RECOMMENDATIONS: 1.  Clopidogrel 75mg and Warfarin with a goal INR of 2-3 for 6 months then replace Clopidogrel with ASA 81mg and continue Warfarin 2.

Based on clinical and genetic factors, it is unclear if this patient is likely to be responsive to clopidogrel at standard doses.   a. Genotype shows likely intermediate CYP2C19 metabolism. CYP2C19 plays a major role in the metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite.  The CYP2C19 *1/*2 genotype may be associated with reduced platelet inhibition, increased residual platelet aggregation, and increased risk for adverse cardiovascular events with clopidogrel. b. Prasugrel or ticagrelor can be considered if no contraindications exist (moderate CPIC recommendation strength).  c. Will proceed w/ Accumetrics for phenotyping. D/w Dr Groves, pref continuing w/ clopidogrel due to concurrent warfarin. Will switch to alternate antiplatelet if phenotype necessitates.    2. Using genetics to guide antiplatelet therapy may result in more effective prevention of adverse cardiovascular events.  a. JACC Cardiovasc Interv. 2018;11(2):181-91. b. NEJM 2009;360:354-62.  c. JAMA 2009;302:849-57.   3. However, controlled clinical trials have yet to be published showing that genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy prevents cardiovascular outcomes.   a. Current consensus guidelines state that the evidence base is currently insufficient to recommend routine genetic testing in all patients undergoing PCI.  But, it also states that there may be a potential role in patients undergoing high-risk PCI procedures such as unprotected left main, bifurcating left main, or last patent coronary artery (JACC 2011;58:e44-122). b.

Anticoagulation Indication:  Atrial fibrillation 427.31 (CHADS-VASc = 4 (CAD, Female, Age x 2)).   Risk Factors for Thrombosis:  Age over 50, Central venous catheterization (non-tunneled catheter placement 2/15/2018), PCI with DES placement to LAD and LCx on 2/19/18.   Risk Factors for Bleeding:  Age greater than 65 years, Renal insufficiency (ESRD on HD), Antiplatelet therapy (Plan for ticagrelor 90 mg BID + warfarin x 6 months (~mid August 2018), followed by aspirin 81 mg daily + warfarin therapy), HASBLED = 3 (Age, ESRD, meds).   Goal INR:  INR low goal:  2, INR high goal:  3.   Length of Therapy:  Indefinite.   Referring Provider:       Referring MD: Auseon DO, Alex.   Visit type:  New patient - consult.   History of Present Illness:  Upon initial presentation to ATC on 2/26/18, this was a  80 yo AAF with h/o paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, COPD, ESRD on HD, asthma, gout who was recently transferred from St. Anthony's for elective LHC at UIH as part of diagnostic work up for fistula replacement. Patient presented to UIH ER with slightly elevated troponin and ECG showed afib. Diagnostic LHC was done which showed significant disease involving the LM, LAD, and LCx as well as moderate AS. Patient was referred to CT surgery for possible CABG +/- AVR, but ultimately it was decided to perform PCI. Pt underwent successful PCI with DES placement to LAD and LCx on 2/19/18. She initially was started on DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel, however it was decided to withhold aspirin therapy in favor of P2Y12 inhibitor + warfarin per the WOEST trial to reduce bleeding. Plan for ticagrelor + warfarin x 6 months (~mid August 2018), followed by aspirin + warfarin therapy. Warfarin was chosen as the anticoagulant of choice due to patient's ESRD and potential increased risk of bleeding with new antiplatelet therapy.   Per inpatientÂ¿s note, patient had been on warfarin in the past without issues but they did not recall the dose strength. During admission, patient received warfarin 5 mg x 2 and warfarin 7.5 mg x 2 doses without much increase in INR, warfarin dose was titrated up. Upon hospital DC on 2/21/18 with INR 1.1,  originally pt was instructed by inpatient team to take warfarin 10 mg daily and f/u with ATC today. However, in the interim, pt received a call from cardiology team to reduce warfarin dose to 7.5 mg daily (these past 3 days) and f/u with ATC today .   Chief complaint:  Pt is here to establish care with ATC. Now on ticagrelor + warfarin x 6 months (~mid August 2018), followed by aspirin + warfarin therapy s/p PCI with multiple DES to LAD, and LCx on 2/19/18. Per inpatientÂ¿s note, patient had been on warfarin in the past without issues but they did not recall the dose strength. During admission, patient received warfarin 5 mg x 2 and warfarin 7.5 mg x 2 doses without much increase in INR, warfarin dose was titrated up. Upon hospital DC on 2/21/18 with INR 1.1,  originally pt was instructed by inpatient team to take warfarin 10 mg daily and f/u with ATC today. However, in the interim, pt received a call from cardiology team to reduce warfarin dose to 7.5 mg daily (these past 3 days) and f/u with ATC today. During visit, pt is feeling well.

Anticoagulation Indication:  Atrial fibrillation 427.31 (CHADS-VASc = 4 (CAD, Female, Age x 2)).   Risk Factors for Thrombosis:  Age over 50, Central venous catheterization (non-tunneled catheter placement 2/15/2018), PCI with DES placement to LAD and LCx on 2/19/18.   Risk Factors for Bleeding:  Age greater than 65 years, Renal insufficiency (ESRD on HD), Antiplatelet therapy (Plan for ticagrelor 90 mg BID + warfarin x 6 months (~mid August 2018), followed by aspirin 81 mg daily + warfarin therapy), HASBLED = 3 (Age, ESRD, meds).   Goal INR:  INR low goal:  2, INR high goal:  3.   Length of Therapy:  Indefinite.   Referring Provider:       Referring MD: Auseon DO, Alex.   Visit type:  Established patient - follow up.   History of Present Illness:  Upon initial presentation to ATC on 2/26/18, this was a  80 yo AAF with h/o paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, COPD, ESRD on HD, asthma, gout who was recently transferred from St. Anthony's for elective LHC at UIH as part of diagnostic work up for fistula replacement. Patient presented to UIH ER with slightly elevated troponin and ECG showed afib. Diagnostic LHC was done which showed significant disease involving the LM, LAD, and LCx as well as moderate AS. Patient was referred to CT surgery for possible CABG +/- AVR, but ultimately it was decided to perform PCI. Pt underwent successful PCI with DES placement to LAD and LCx on 2/19/18. She initially was started on DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel, however it was decided to withhold aspirin therapy in favor of P2Y12 inhibitor + warfarin per the WOEST trial to reduce bleeding. Plan for ticagrelor + warfarin x 6 months (~mid August 2018), followed by aspirin + warfarin therapy. Warfarin was chosen as the anticoagulant of choice due to patient's ESRD and potential increased risk of bleeding with new antiplatelet therapy.   Per inpatientÂ¿s note, patient had been on warfarin in the past without issues but they did not recall the dose strength. During admission, patient received warfarin 5 mg x 2 and warfarin 7.5 mg x 2 doses without much increase in INR, warfarin dose was titrated up. Upon hospital DC on 2/21/18 with INR 1.1,  originally pt was instructed by inpatient team to take warfarin 10 mg daily and f/u with ATC today. However, in the interim, pt received a call from cardiology team to reduce warfarin dose to 7.5 mg daily (these past 3 days) and f/u with ATC today .   Chief complaint:  Pt is here for  f/u visit with ATC. Now on ticagrelor + warfarin x 6 months (~mid August 2018), followed by aspirin + warfarin therapy s/p PCI with multiple DES to LAD, and LCx on 2/19/18. Per inpatient note, patient had been on warfarin in the past without issues but they did not recall the dose strength. Last seen in ATC on 3/7/18 with INR 1.6 and instructed to take warfarin 15 mg Wed, 12.5 mg Thurs/Fri/Sat/Sun and RTC today. During visit, pt is feeling well. Denies s/sx of bleeding. Doing HD Tues/Thurs/Sat at OSH. No acute complaints today.   Accompanied by:  Family member (daughter (Dorothy)).   Source of history:  Self, Family member (daughter (Dorothy)).   History limitation:  None.     Histories  Procedure history:   No active procedure history items have been selected or recorded.    Interval History  Anticoagulant Visit  The general health status is fair.  The nutritional history is high vitamin K foods (once weekly: mustard greens and turnip greens. Okra 2x/weeks) and changes in vitamin K diet (had string beans instead of mustard/turnip greens this week. Will go back to mustard/turnip greens once weekly on Sundays), no green tea and no herbal supplement.  The Social History is denies alcohol, tobacco and drug use and lives with children.

Anticoagulation Indication:  Atrial fibrillation 427.31 (CHADS-VASc = 4 (CAD, Female, Age x 2)).   Risk Factors for Thrombosis:  Age over 50, Central venous catheterization (non-tunneled catheter placement 2/15/2018), PCI with DES placement to LAD and LCx on 2/19/18.   Risk Factors for Bleeding:  Age greater than 65 years, Renal insufficiency (ESRD on HD), Antiplatelet therapy (Plan for ticagrelor 90 mg BID + warfarin x 6 months (~mid August 2018), followed by aspirin 81 mg daily + warfarin therapy), HASBLED = 3 (Age, ESRD, meds).   Goal INR:  INR low goal:  2, INR high goal:  3.   Length of Therapy:  Indefinite.   Referring Provider:       Referring MD: Auseon DO, Alex.   Visit type:  New patient - consult.   History of Present Illness:  Upon initial presentation to ATC on 2/26/18, this was a  80 yo AAF with h/o paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, COPD, ESRD on HD, asthma, gout who was recently transferred from St. Anthony's for elective LHC at UIH as part of diagnostic work up for fistula replacement. Patient presented to UIH ER with slightly elevated troponin and ECG showed afib. Diagnostic LHC was done which showed significant disease involving the LM, LAD, and LCx as well as moderate AS. Patient was referred to CT surgery for possible CABG +/- AVR, but ultimately it was decided to perform PCI. Pt underwent successful PCI with DES placement to LAD and LCx on 2/19/18. She initially was started on DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel, however it was decided to withhold aspirin therapy in favor of P2Y12 inhibitor + warfarin per the WOEST trial to reduce bleeding. Plan for ticagrelor + warfarin x 6 months (~mid August 2018), followed by aspirin + warfarin therapy. Warfarin was chosen as the anticoagulant of choice due to patient's ESRD and potential increased risk of bleeding with new antiplatelet therapy.   Per inpatientÂ¿s note, patient had been on warfarin in the past without issues but they did not recall the dose strength. During admission, patient received warfarin 5 mg x 2 and warfarin 7.5 mg x 2 doses without much increase in INR, warfarin dose was titrated up. Upon hospital DC on 2/21/18 with INR 1.1,  originally pt was instructed by inpatient team to take warfarin 10 mg daily and f/u with ATC today. However, in the interim, pt received a call from cardiology team to reduce warfarin dose to 7.5 mg daily (these past 3 days) and f/u with ATC today .   Chief complaint:  Pt is here for  f/u visit with ATC. Now on ticagrelor + warfarin x 6 months (~mid August 2018), followed by aspirin + warfarin therapy s/p PCI with multiple DES to LAD, and LCx on 2/19/18. Per inpatient note, patient had been on warfarin in the past without issues but they did not recall the dose strength. Last seen in ATC on 3/2 for first f/u visit with INR 1.3 and instructed to take warfarin 12.5 mg Fri/Sat, 10 mg Sun, 12.5 mg Mon/Tue and RTC today (Weds). During visit, pt is feeling well. Denies s/sx of bleeding. Doing HD Tues/Thurs/Sat at OSH. No acute complaints today.   Accompanied by:  Family member (daughter (Dorothy)).   Source of history:  Self, Family member (daughter (Dorothy)).   History limitation:  None.     Histories  Procedure history:   No active procedure history items have been selected or recorded.

Anticoagulation Indication:  Atrial fibrillation 427.31 (CHADS-VASc = 4 (CAD, Female, Age x 2)).   Risk Factors for Thrombosis:  Age over 50, Central venous catheterization (non-tunneled catheter placement 2/15/2018), PCI with DES placement to LAD and LCx on 2/19/18.   Risk Factors for Bleeding:  Age greater than 65 years, Renal insufficiency (ESRD on HD), Antiplatelet therapy (Plan for ticagrelor 90 mg BID + warfarin x 6 months (~mid August 2018), followed by aspirin 81 mg daily + warfarin therapy), HASBLED = 3 (Age, ESRD, meds).   Goal INR:  INR low goal:  2, INR high goal:  3.   Length of Therapy:  Indefinite.   Referring Provider:       Referring MD: Auseon DO, Alex.   Visit type:  Established patient - follow up.   History of Present Illness:  Upon initial presentation to ATC on 2/26/18, this was a  80 yo AAF with h/o paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, COPD, ESRD on HD, asthma, gout who was recently transferred from St. Anthony's for elective LHC at UIH as part of diagnostic work up for fistula replacement. Patient presented to UIH ER with slightly elevated troponin and ECG showed afib. Diagnostic LHC was done which showed significant disease involving the LM, LAD, and LCx as well as moderate AS. Patient was referred to CT surgery for possible CABG +/- AVR, but ultimately it was decided to perform PCI. Pt underwent successful PCI with DES placement to LAD and LCx on 2/19/18. She initially was started on DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel, however it was decided to withhold aspirin therapy in favor of P2Y12 inhibitor + warfarin per the WOEST trial to reduce bleeding. Plan for ticagrelor + warfarin x 6 months (~mid August 2018), followed by aspirin + warfarin therapy. Warfarin was chosen as the anticoagulant of choice due to patient's ESRD and potential increased risk of bleeding with new antiplatelet therapy.   Per inpatientÂ¿s note, patient had been on warfarin in the past without issues but they did not recall the dose strength. During admission, patient received warfarin 5 mg x 2 and warfarin 7.5 mg x 2 doses without much increase in INR, warfarin dose was titrated up. Upon hospital DC on 2/21/18 with INR 1.1,  originally pt was instructed by inpatient team to take warfarin 10 mg daily and f/u with ATC today. However, in the interim, pt received a call from cardiology team to reduce warfarin dose to 7.5 mg daily (these past 3 days) and f/u with ATC today .   Chief complaint:  Pt is here for  f/u visit with ATC. Plan for ticagrelor + warfarin x 6 months (~mid August 2018), followed by aspirin + warfarin therapy s/p PCI with multiple DES to LAD, and LCx on 2/19/18.  Pt was last seen in ATC on 3/12/18 with INR 1.7 and instructed to take warfarin 15 mg Mon/Tue/Thu and 12.5mg Wed with RTC on Friday.  Today, pt reports feeling well.  Reports adherence to warfarin with no missed doses.  Denies s/sx of bleeding or any new complaints.  Pt has HD Tues/Thurs/Sat at OSH.   Accompanied by:  Family member (daughter (Dorothy)).

Anticoagulation Indication:  Atrial fibrillation 427.31 (CHADS-VASc = 4 (CAD, Female, Age x 2)).   Risk Factors for Thrombosis:  Age over 50, Central venous catheterization (non-tunneled catheter placement 2/15/2018), PCI with DES placement to LAD and LCx on 2/19/18.   Risk Factors for Bleeding:  Age greater than 65 years, Renal insufficiency (ESRD on HD), Antiplatelet therapy (Plan for ticagrelor 90 mg BID + warfarin x 6 months (~mid August 2018), followed by aspirin 81 mg daily + warfarin therapy), HASBLED = 3 (Age, ESRD, meds).   Goal INR:  INR low goal:  2, INR high goal:  3.   Length of Therapy:  Indefinite.   Referring Provider:       Referring MD: Auseon DO, Alex.   Visit type:  Established patient - follow up.   History of Present Illness:  Upon initial presentation to ATC on 2/26/18, this was a  80 yo AAF with h/o paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, COPD, ESRD on HD, asthma, gout who was recently transferred from St. Anthony's for elective LHC at UIH as part of diagnostic work up for fistula replacement. Patient presented to UIH ER with slightly elevated troponin and ECG showed afib. Diagnostic LHC was done which showed significant disease involving the LM, LAD, and LCx as well as moderate AS. Patient was referred to CT surgery for possible CABG +/- AVR, but ultimately it was decided to perform PCI. Pt underwent successful PCI with DES placement to LAD and LCx on 2/19/18. She initially was started on DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel, however it was decided to withhold aspirin therapy in favor of P2Y12 inhibitor + warfarin per the WOEST trial to reduce bleeding. Plan for ticagrelor + warfarin x 6 months (~mid August 2018), followed by aspirin + warfarin therapy. Warfarin was chosen as the anticoagulant of choice due to patient's ESRD and potential increased risk of bleeding with new antiplatelet therapy.   Per inpatientÂ¿s note, patient had been on warfarin in the past without issues but they did not recall the dose strength. During admission, patient received warfarin 5 mg x 2 and warfarin 7.5 mg x 2 doses without much increase in INR, warfarin dose was titrated up. Upon hospital DC on 2/21/18 with INR 1.1,  originally pt was instructed by inpatient team to take warfarin 10 mg daily and f/u with ATC today. However, in the interim, pt received a call from cardiology team to reduce warfarin dose to 7.5 mg daily (these past 3 days) and f/u with ATC today .   Chief complaint:  Pt is here for  f/u visit with ATC.  Pt was started on warfarin therapy for atrial fibrillation after recent PCI with DES on 2/19/18.  Plan for ticagrelor + warfarin x 6 months (~mid August 2018), followed by aspirin + warfarin therapy.  Pt was last seen in ATC on 3/21/18 with INR 2.7 and was instructed to continue same TWD of warfarin with  15 mg Tu/Th/Sa and 12.5 mg other days.  Today, pt reports feeling well.  Reports adherence to warfarin with no missed doses.  Denies changes in medications but reports no vit K intake this week (usually once a week).  Denies s/sx of bleeding or any new complaints.  Pt has HD Tues/Thurs/Sat at OSH.   Accompanied by:  Family member (daughter (Dorothy)).   Source of history:  Self, Family member (daughter (Dorothy)).   History limitation:  None.

Anticoagulation Indication:  Atrial fibrillation 427.31 (CHADS-VASc = 4 (CAD, Female, Age x 2)).   Risk Factors for Thrombosis:  Age over 50, Central venous catheterization (non-tunneled catheter placement 2/15/2018), PCI with DES placement to LAD and LCx on 2/19/18.   Risk Factors for Bleeding:  Age greater than 65 years, Renal insufficiency (ESRD on HD), Antiplatelet therapy (Plan for ticagrelor 90 mg BID + warfarin x 6 months (~mid August 2018), followed by aspirin 81 mg daily + warfarin therapy), HASBLED = 3 (Age, ESRD, meds).   Goal INR:  INR low goal:  2, INR high goal:  3.   Length of Therapy:  Indefinite.   Referring Provider:       Referring MD: Auseon DO, Alex.   Visit type:  Established patient - follow up.   History of Present Illness:  Upon initial presentation to ATC on 2/26/18, this was a  80 yo AAF with h/o paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, COPD, ESRD on HD, asthma, gout who was recently transferred from St. Anthony's for elective LHC at UIH as part of diagnostic work up for fistula replacement. Patient presented to UIH ER with slightly elevated troponin and ECG showed afib. Diagnostic LHC was done which showed significant disease involving the LM, LAD, and LCx as well as moderate AS. Patient was referred to CT surgery for possible CABG +/- AVR, but ultimately it was decided to perform PCI. Pt underwent successful PCI with DES placement to LAD and LCx on 2/19/18. She initially was started on DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel, however it was decided to withhold aspirin therapy in favor of P2Y12 inhibitor + warfarin per the WOEST trial to reduce bleeding. Plan for ticagrelor + warfarin x 6 months (~mid August 2018), followed by aspirin + warfarin therapy. Warfarin was chosen as the anticoagulant of choice due to patient's ESRD and potential increased risk of bleeding with new antiplatelet therapy.   Per inpatientÂ¿s note, patient had been on warfarin in the past without issues but they did not recall the dose strength. During admission, patient received warfarin 5 mg x 2 and warfarin 7.5 mg x 2 doses without much increase in INR, warfarin dose was titrated up. Upon hospital DC on 2/21/18 with INR 1.1,  originally pt was instructed by inpatient team to take warfarin 10 mg daily and f/u with ATC today. However, in the interim, pt received a call from cardiology team to reduce warfarin dose to 7.5 mg daily (these past 3 days) and f/u with ATC today .   Chief complaint:  Pt is here for  f/u visit with ATC.  Last seen 3/28/18 with INR 3.8 and was instructed to decrease warfarin dose to 12.5mg daily. No new complaints today. On DAPT until at least AUg 2018.  Pt has HD Tues/Thurs/Sat at OSH.   Accompanied by:  Family member (daughter (Dorothy)).   Source of history:  Self, Family member (daughter (Dorothy)).

Successful deployment of a 29 mm CoreValve Evolut Pro valve in the aortic position. 8.  Balloon aortic valuloplasty with a 22 mm Z-Med balloon. 9.  Mynx vascular closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site.  CO-SURGEONS: 1.   Khaled Abdelhady, MD 2.   Elliott Groves, MD  ASSISTING PHYSICIANS: 1.  David Casey, MD  ANESTHESIOLOGIST: 1. Katharina Beckmann, MD  PREPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: 1.  Severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. 2.  AFib 3.  CAD sp PCI  POSTPROCEDURE DIAGNOSES:  1.  Severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. 2.  Successful deployment of a 29 mm CoreValve Evolut RPO valve in the aortic position via right transfemoral access.  Brief Clinical note Mrs Daizella Vesey is an extremely pleasant 80 yo woman with severe aortic stenosis who presented with dyspnea and heart failure and was found to have severe aortic stenosis. She was felt to be a high risk candidate for surgical aortic valve replacement and presented for TAVR. Due to the complexity of this procedure and the need of two operators to deploy the core valve; I scrubbed as a co-surgeon with dr Groves. The steps below were shared with alternate roles. I deployed the valve while dr Groves was controling the positioning and depth of the valve. The decision making as to the position , seal, hemodynamics, echo and flouro of the valve was a shared decsioins as well   Operative Details: The risks, benefits, and alternatives, have been discussed with the patient , the patient signed informed consent.  .   sterile prep. was used to establish the surgical field whisch  was then isolated with sterile towels and ioband.   1% lidocaine solution was used for local anesthesia and a 6-French pinnacle sheath was placed in the left femoral artery using a modified Seldinger technique. A 7-French pinnacle sheath was then placed in the left femoral vein using a modified Seldinger technique.  A left iliofemoral angiogram was performed in the LAO projection. Through the, femoral venous sheath, we advanced a transvenous pacer into the right ventricle and confirmed adequate pacing capture.  We then advanced a 5-French rim catheter with a Glidewire through the left femoral arterial sheath, and advanced it into the right external iliac artery.  A direct anterior puncture of the right femoral artery was performed using fluoroscopy and direct visualization with contrast injection through the rim catheter.  Two Perclose suture devices were deployed in a preclose fashion.  We serially dilated the arteriotomy site with a 12-French dilator followed by a 14-French then over the wire, advanced a 16-French Cook sheath.    We advanced a 6-French pigtail catheter through the left femoral arterial sheath into the ascending aorta and performed ascending aortography to confirm optimal deployment angles. Through the right femoral arterial sheath, we advanced an AL1 diagnostic catheter over a J wire and then exchanged for a straight wire, which we used to cross the aortic valve.  The AL1 diagnostic catheter was advanced into the left ventricle and the wire was exchanged for an exchange length J wire, which was advanced to the apex.  The AL1 was removed from the body, and an angled pigtail catheter was advanced over this wire into the left ventricle to obtain simultaneous left ventricular and aortic pressures.  A Confida wire was then advanced through the left ventricular pigtail catheter and we removed the pigtail catheter.  We then removed the Cook sheath and inserted the 29 mm CoreValve Evolut R valve using the in line sheath and passed it into the descending thoracic aorta.  The valve was advanced across the aortic arch across and then the aortic annulus.  We successfully deployed the 29 mm CoreValve Evolut Pro valve.    The valve delivery system was then removed followed by reinsertion of the Cook sheath and passage of the pigtail catheter into the left ventricle. Simultaneous left ventricular and aortic pressures showed no residual gradient, however, there was some aortic insufficiency, and thus a 22mm Z-Med balloon was used for post dilation. Final ascending aortography showed no significant aortic insufficiency.  The pigtail catheter was then removed, followed by removal of the Cook sheath, with deployment of the Perclose suture devices.  The left femoral arteriotomy was then closed using a Mnyx device.  Protamine was administered to reverse the ACT and the temp wire was removed.  The procedure was tolerated well without complications and heparin was used for anticoagulation during the case and verified with ACT measurements.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications. The valve position and sealing against the native valve annulus was confirmed by Echo , hemodynamics and flouroscopy. The Patient was transported out of the OR in a stable condition."

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Malfunctioning right arm arteriovenous graft with steal syndrome.  PROCEDURES: 1. Right arm AV fistulogram. 2. First-order catheterization of the right brachial artery. 3. Right upper extremity angiogram with supervision and interpretation.  SURGEON:  Taylor D Hicks, MD.  ANESTHESIA:  Local.  ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  Less than 10 mL.  SPECIMEN:  None.  COMPLICATION:  None.  INDICATION:  Ms. Vesey has a history of end-stage renal disease and had a right axillary-axillary AV loop graft created for permanent hemodialysis access.  Postoperatively, she was found to have steal syndrome with weakness in her right hand.  She was therefore brought to the cath lab for angiography to assess her graft as well as to assess her for an inflow stenosis.  ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:  The AV graft was patent from the arterial anastomosis through the venous anastomosis.  The axillary vein, subclavian vein, innominate vein, and superior vena cava were all widely patent without significant stenosis.  The innominate artery, right subclavian artery, and right axillary artery were all patent without significant stenosis.  The brachial artery distal to the anastomosis of the graft was patent, but was diminutive in size. Additionally, we observed reflux from the more distal artery back into the AV graft, consistent with steal syndrome.  PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  After informed consent was obtained, she was brought to the cath lab and placed in the supine position upon the table.  She was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  The arterial limb of the graft was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  Using modified Seldinger technique, the micropuncture needle was exchanged for a micropuncture sheath and upsized to a 5-French sheath.  The introducer and wire were removed, and an AV fistulogram was performed with findings as noted above.  We advanced a glide catheter and a Glidewire through the sheath and using this catheter and wire combination, we were able to cross the arterial anastomosis of the AV graft and directed both wire and catheter into the innominate artery.  The wire was removed, and an angiogram was performed with findings as noted above.  We pulled the catheter back into the axillary artery and repeated an angiogram. The catheter was then pulled back further to the level of the anastomosis with the graft.  An angiogram was performed that demonstrated significant reflux in the diminutive brachial artery distal to the anastomosis.  We attempted with multiple catheters to direct the wire into the more distal brachial artery, but were unsuccessful due to its small size; however, since we did not see an inflow stenosis and since we did observe reflux from the more distal vessels, we confirmed the diagnosis of steal and made the decision to end the procedure with a plan of ligating her graft at a later date.  A 2-0 Prolene suture was placed as a U-stitch around the sheath and the sheath was removed.  Additional pressure was applied for hemostasis.  Dressing was applied.  She tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room in good condition.  I was present for the entire case.

Anticoagulation Indication:  Atrial fibrillation 427.31 (CHADS-VASc = 4 (CAD, Female, Age x 2)).   Risk Factors for Thrombosis:  Age over 50, Central venous catheterization (non-tunneled catheter placement 2/15/2018), PCI with DES placement to LAD and LCx on 2/19/18.   Risk Factors for Bleeding:  Age greater than 65 years, Renal insufficiency (ESRD on HD), Antiplatelet therapy (Plan for ticagrelor 90 mg BID + warfarin x 6 months (~mid August 2018), followed by aspirin 81 mg daily + warfarin therapy), HASBLED = 3 (Age, ESRD, meds).   Goal INR:  INR low goal:  2, INR high goal:  3.   Length of Therapy:  Indefinite.   Referring Provider:       Referring MD: Auseon DO, Alex.   Visit type:  Established patient - follow up.   History of Present Illness:  Upon initial presentation to ATC on 2/26/18, this was a  80 yo AAF with h/o paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, COPD, ESRD on HD, asthma, gout who was recently transferred from St. Anthony's for elective LHC at UIH as part of diagnostic work up for fistula replacement. Patient presented to UIH ER with slightly elevated troponin and ECG showed afib. Diagnostic LHC was done which showed significant disease involving the LM, LAD, and LCx as well as moderate AS. Patient was referred to CT surgery for possible CABG +/- AVR, but ultimately it was decided to perform PCI. Pt underwent successful PCI with DES placement to LAD and LCx on 2/19/18. She initially was started on DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel, however it was decided to withhold aspirin therapy in favor of P2Y12 inhibitor + warfarin per the WOEST trial to reduce bleeding. Plan for ticagrelor + warfarin x 6 months (~mid August 2018), followed by aspirin + warfarin therapy. Warfarin was chosen as the anticoagulant of choice due to patient's ESRD and potential increased risk of bleeding with new antiplatelet therapy.   Per inpatientÂ¿s note, patient had been on warfarin in the past without issues but they did not recall the dose strength. During admission, patient received warfarin 5 mg x 2 and warfarin 7.5 mg x 2 doses without much increase in INR, warfarin dose was titrated up. Upon hospital DC on 2/21/18 with INR 1.1,  originally pt was instructed by inpatient team to take warfarin 10 mg daily and f/u with ATC today. However, in the interim, pt received a call from cardiology team to reduce warfarin dose to 7.5 mg daily (these past 3 days) and f/u with ATC today .   Chief complaint:  Pt is here for  f/u visit with ATC.  Pt was started on warfarin therapy for atrial fibrillation after recent PCI with DES on 2/19/18.  Plan for ticagrelor + warfarin x 6 months (~mid August 2018), followed by aspirin + warfarin therapy.  Pt was last seen in ATC on 3/16/18 with INR 2.5 and was instructed to continue same weekly dose with warfarin 12.5mg Fri/Sun/Mon and 15mg Sat/Tue with RTC on Wednesday.  Today, pt reports feeling well.  Reports adherence to warfarin with no missed doses.  Denies changes in medications/diet.  Denies s/sx of bleeding or any new complaints.  Pt has HD Tues/Thurs/Sat at OSH.   Accompanied by:  Family member (daughter (Dorothy)).   Source of history:  Self, Family member (daughter (Dorothy)).   History limitation:  None.

She is 81 years old. She has end-stage renal disease, currently dialyzed via an indwelling left internal jugular PermCath.  She has had previous PermCath on the right side based on the scars in her right anterior chest wall.  She has a failed left upper arm arteriovenous graft.  I sent her for upper extremity arterial blood flow studies and vein mapping at the time of her last visit.  Her upper extremity vein mapping is symmetrically unfavorable with cephalic veins less than 2 mm and basilic veins less than 3 mm.  She has nonpalpable pulses in the bilateral radial positions, but no significant clinical ischemia of the upper extremities.  Noninvasive arterial Doppler studies of the bilateral upper extremities are remarkable for near normal waveforms of the level of the wrist.  Treatment options were discussed with the patient and her daughter. Next best intervention is probably an axillary loop graft and based on her prior left arm surgery, I would recommend proceeding with an AV graft in the right upper extremity.  This will be scheduled at the patient's request for February.  The patient is on aspirin and Eliquis for cardiac indications.  I have instructed them to continue their aspirin and discontinue the Eliquis 3 days prior to surgery.    DD:  12/19/2018 10:54:29 DT:  12/20/2018 04:52:06 MB/MedQ JOB:  007844/818866350"

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Vesey presents to the office today for reassessment after her recent right axillary-axillary AV loop graft placement. She states that since the procedure she has noticed some numbness over her 4th and 5th digits in the right hand.  Additionally, she states that her grip strength has decreased.  She otherwise denies any complaints.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital Signs:  Temperature 36.7, heart rate 76, blood pressure 76/39, height 5 feet 2 inches, weight 149 pounds.  General:  Awake and alert, in no acute distress.  Musculoskeletal:  No bony abnormalities are appreciated.  Her axillary incision is healing well.  She has some mild dehiscence of the skin of her counter incision near the antecubital fossa. The tissue underneath the skin is intact with no surrounding cellulitis or drainage from the wound, and there is no exposed graft.  Vascular:  Her right radial pulse is not palpable.  She does have a thrill in the graft, but it is weak.  Neuro:  She has decreased grip strength in the right hand compared to the left side.  ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  End-stage renal disease, status post right axillary-axillary arteriovenous loop graft, now with probable steal syndrome:  She has change in her neurologic function following her AV graft placement and no longer has palpable right radial pulse.  I believe she likely has steal syndrome, and we will schedule her at the next available date for a right arm AV fistulogram with right arm angiogram to look for inflow or outflow stenosis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr Salgado is a 69-year-old gentleman who comes today for evaluation of his right shoulder pain.  He has had it for the past 2 years.  He says that he has significant problems reaching overhead and combing his hair.  He localizes the pain laterally.  He has a remote history of a rotator cuff repair done elsewhere about 15 years ago.  He takes Tylenol as needed for his pain.  He has not done any physical therapy, nor has he had any injections.  He is right-hand dominant.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension and remote history of a stroke.  PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for the right rotator cuff repair as above.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On exam today, the patient is awake and alert, in no apparent distress.  Examination of his right upper extremity shows that he actually has pretty good active range of motion with active forward flexion to 160, passive to 180.  He can externally rotate passively with the arm abducted to 90 degrees, internally rotate to 20 degrees, and this is symmetric to the contralateral side.  Strength of his supraspinatus is 4/5.  He has a negative belly press.  He is neurovascularly intact distally.  IMAGING:  X-rays taken today show that he is status post a rotator cuff repair.  He has a high-riding humeral head and changes consistent with rotator cuff arthropathy.  ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mr Salgado is a 69-year-old gentleman with right shoulder rotator cuff arthropathy at this time.  He has not exhausted all of his conservative therapies.  Therefore, we will send him for physical therapy for 6 weeks' time.  If at that time he feels better, he does not need to follow up.  If he is not feeling better at that time, we will discuss with him whether he wants to live with it the way that it is or undergo a reverse total shoulder arthroplasty.  He voiced understanding and agreement with this plan. Questions were answered.  He was seen and examined by Dr Goldberg who agrees with the above.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Salgado is a 70-year-old gentleman who returns to the clinic for evaluation of right shoulder pain.  He was last here in May, where he was diagnosed with right shoulder rotator cuff arthropathy. at that time, he was advised to go to Physical Therapy, and since his last visit with the physical therapy he states that his pain has completely gone away and he has regained significant function in his shoulder.  He feels that the physical therapy worked very well and he is very happy with his outcome.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  The patient is in no acute distress.  He is alert and oriented x3.  Nonlabored breathing.  Examination of the right upper extremity revealed a normal appearing shoulder with no muscle atrophy.  Range of motion in the right shoulder was forward flexion to 180 degrees, __________ to 170 degrees, 35 degrees of external rotation and 90 degrees of internal rotation.  The patient has 5/5 strength in all muscle groups in the right upper extremity.  He has a negative empty can sign as well as a negative belly press sign.  The patient's right upper extremity was neurovascularly intact.  ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mr. Salgado is a 70-year-old male with rotator cuff arthropathy who has recently completed a month of physical therapy and he reports that his pain has almost completely gone away, and he has regained a lot of the function that he was missing due to his pain that he was having before.  He feels very happy with this outcome.  He has 1 more appointment for physical therapy and we have advised him that he can learn how to do these exercises on his own and continue to do them at home; he does not have to keep going to any more physical therapy.  We also advised the patient that he may followup on an as needed basis should any new problems arise.  The patient agreed and understood this plan.  Dr. Goldberg was present, evaluated the patient, and also agrees with the plan.

The patient is competent. The risks and                       benefits of the procedure and the sedation options and                       risks were discussed with the patient. All questions                       were answered and informed consent was obtained. Patient                       identification and proposed procedure were verified by                       the physician, the nurse, the anesthesiologist, the                       anesthetist and the technician in the pre-procedure area                       in the procedure room in the endoscopy suite.

After reviewing the risks and benefits, the                       patient was deemed in satisfactory condition to undergo                       the procedure. The anesthesia plan was to use monitored                       anesthesia care (MAC). Immediately prior to                       administration of medications, the patient was                       re-assessed for adequacy to receive sedatives. The heart                       rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturations, blood                       pressure, adequacy of pulmonary ventilation, and                       response to care were monitored throughout the                       procedure. The physical status of the patient was                       re-assessed after the procedure.                      After obtaining informed consent, the colonoscope was                       passed under direct vision. Throughout the procedure,                       the patient's blood pressure, pulse, and oxygen                       saturations were monitored continuously. The Colonoscope                       was introduced through the anus and advanced to the                       rectal stump. Then introduced through the colostomy and                       advanced to the cecum, identified by appendiceal orifice                       and ileocecal valve. The colonoscopy was performed                       without difficulty. The patient tolerated the procedure                       well. The quality of the bowel preparation was adequate                       to identify polyps. Findings:      The perianal and digital rectal examinations were normal.      A 4 mm polyp was found in the transverse colon. The polyp was sessile.       Polypectomy was attempted, initially using a cold snare. Polyp resection       was incomplete with this device. This intervention then required a       different device and polypectomy technique. The polyp was removed with a       cold biopsy forceps. Resection and retrieval were complete.      The exam was otherwise without abnormality. Impression:          - One 4 mm polyp in the transverse colon, removed with a                       cold biopsy forceps. Resected and retrieved.                      - The examination was otherwise normal. Recommendation:      - Discharge patient to home.                      - Resume previous diet.                      - Continue present medications.                      - Await pathology results.                      - Return to referring physician in 4 weeks.

He was seen in the ED yesterday, 8/2, and had a TSH which was within normal range. Mom states that she was told to schedule an appointment soon with Dr. Boucher-Berry to discuss any medication changes. I added on a Free T4 which was 1.1. Called mother to inform her that I would touch base with Dr. Boucher-Berry once she returned from vacation to see when she would like patient to come for follow up. I reassured her that it is very unlikely for Adrian's symptoms to be due to his thyroid as his thyroid function tests are completely normal. He should continue his current dose of levothyroxine.

Patient deniea symptoms such as headache, blurred vision, dizziness, lightheadedness. Manual BP checked 136/64.  ABPM instructions discussed with parent and patient as follows:  The Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitor (ABPM) will help to look at how your blood pressure fluctuates throughout the day.  To do so, a blood pressure cuff and monitor will be worn to measure your blood pressures for the next 24 hours.   Please follow these instructions to complete this study: 1) You will receive an ABPM activity log to keep over the next 24 hours.  Please write down your activities ( sitting, standing, lying down, talking, relaxing, eating, walking ), including what time you woke up, went to sleep, played, exercised, also if you is upset/feeling stressed, has headache, dizziness, or in pain. 2) The blood pressure cuff is preset to measure your blood pressure every 30 minutes during the day and every 60 minutes at night while you are sleeping. 3) The blood pressure cuff should be worn continuously except when showering or bathing.  Keep the monitor dry and do not drop it. 4) Once the 24 hours are over, you may remove the blood pressure cuff and turn off the monitor.  To turn off the monitor, hold the Start/Stop button for 5 seconds.  The monitor will beep 5 times and the display will turn off. 5) Write down the time you finished the study and remove the cuff. 6) Please return the blood pressure cuff and monitor promptly. Activity log explained and given to patient to record activities/events throughout the day. Patient instructed to keep arm relaxed ( avoid excessive movement, avoid hand movement, avoid flexing arm) when monitor is taking BP measurement. Showed parent/patient how to properly put back the sleeve/cuff on the arm in case it is necessary to be removed in between readings, although, patient and parent encouraged not to take it off as much as possible. Emphasized taking care to make sure monitor does not get wet or dropped and that both parent and patient should take responsibility for the care of the monitor. Parent and patient were able to repeat instructions given. Mother instructed to promptly return the monitor and BP cuff with filled out activity log, agreeable and verbalized understanding. Stayed for 2 readings 30 minutes apart to ensure machine is working as programmed. Mother given my phone number and encouraged to call in case she has further questions and concerns/problem during ABPM. Time: 30 min R. Dimacuha, RN"

I originally saw him on 5/10/16 with a rash that I didn't think was erythema migrans (target lesions) and I told him to follow up if he had any other symptoms (fever, athralgias, headache, etc.) Anyway, he ended up in the ER that week and was diagnosed with Lyme Disease and given ?Doxy for 21 days.   I colleague of mine ordered """"routine"""" labs on him for checkup in Sept. which showed high TSH. Labs were repeated in November and TSH was even higher (will list labs below) and per parents request, he repeated Lyme titers which were elevated. Turns out Lyme titers can stay elevated for weeks, months, or even years after treatment. That being said, my colleague put him back on Doxy for 21 day course. I saw him yesterday for possible C. Diff from the Doxy and saw all these lab results that were not addressed. So, I currently have C Diff toxin labs brewing, I stopped the Doxy and he will see you on Friday.   Endo labs from us: 9/20/16 Vit-D 25-OH: 24.9 TSH: 26.320  11/1/16 TSH: 38.440 Free T4: 0.63  Weight/Height:  5/10/16: Weight 156lbs 10/27/16: Weight 172lbs, Height 5'10.6"""" 11/29/16: Weight 163lbs  Hope this helps. Seems like there is a lot of cases in literature with Lyme Disease induced Hashimoto's (had my med students work on that one yesterday). He is assymptomatic (currently actually has diarrhea).   Let me know and I will follow as well.  Tim"

Course:  Adrian has an elevated TSH (which is currently rising) associated with a goiter on examination.  There is no family history of autoimmune disease, but given his presentation, he most likely has Hashimoto's thyroiditis.  Explained the disease to Adrian and his mother and we discussed the treatment.  Will start him on Synthroid- 75 mcg daily.  Discussed the appropriate way to take the medication.  Will have him start the medicine and then repeat the blood tests along with antibodies in 6 weeks. BP is elevated, but this is the first time I am seeing him.  Will continue to monitor..   Plan:  1) Start Synthroid 75 mcg daily 2) Repeat TSH, free T4, thyroid peroxidase ab, thyroglobulin ab  in 6 weeks 3) Will continue to monitor blood pressure 4) Follow-up in 6 months.

Course:  Adrian is clinically and biochemically euthyroid (family reports that they had blood tests done last month- which were normal- will request a copy of the results from PCP).  He has lost 27 pounds over the past year and is experiencing daily diarrhea-  both of which would be consistent with Celiac disease.  Explained to the family that he needs a GI workup- would begin with ESR and Celiac panel and then consider referral to GI.  Due to the fact that he has autoimmune hypothyroidism, he is at risk for other autoimmune conditions which would includ celiac and IBD..   Plan:  1) Continue Synthroid 88 mcg daily 2) Obtain TSh and free T4 results from PCP 3) lab slip given- celiac panel, total IgA, ESR, CBC with diff 4) Follow-up will be determined by lab results.

He was losing a significant amount of weight and labs didn't point to anything specific except for a slightly elevated free T4.  We took him off of the medication about two months ago.  His latest TSH is elevated, so I know that he needs the medicine.  I spoke to Adrian's mom.  She said that off of the Levothyroxine he has gained 15 pounds.I am starting him on a lower dose of the medication and have asked her to have him repeat the labs at Union in 2 months. I am hoping that the weight loss is done, but will continue to keep an eye on it.  Let me know if you need anything from my side.  Thanks, Claudia"

The patient has done fairly well.  She will get occasional pain, but her main concern is she suffered 2 falls in the last 2 months, the last one being about 2 weeks ago while at church.  She was kneeling and when she got up from the kneeling position, the knee buckled and gave out on her and she fell.  She does not have any complaints of pain at this time.  The patient is no longer getting any physical therapy but says she does perform home exercises about twice a week. The patient denies any fevers, nausea, vomiting or any drainage from her knee.  Today on examination, the patient is alert and oriented.  She does not appear to be in any acute distress.  Currently, she rates her pain as a 0/10.  The knee is clean, dry, and intact.  There are no signs of any infection.  Range of motion today actively is about 0 degrees to 108 degrees.  The knee is very stable.  She is neurovascularly intact distally and she does have good strength in the quads as she is able hold the leg in active extension and I am unable to break that extension.  We did send the patient for x-rays today which demonstrate the prosthesis to be in good position without any signs of loosening.  There are no acute fractures or dislocations noted.  The x-rays are unchanged from the previous ones done earlier this year.  We would wish that the patient not kneel anymore.  We are going to order some more physical therapy, working on some strengthening, balance, gait training and fall prevention.  The patient will then follow up with us in 2 months.  Should she have any problems and need to come back sooner, she is instructed to contact the clinic.  The patient did voice an understanding of the current treatment plan and this patient was seen with Dr. Gonzalez who agrees with the above assessment and plan.

At that time, we had ordered some physical therapy, which she has been doing ever since.  She is following up with us today and says she is doing better.  She has not had any falls since her last visit here.  The patient will use a cane and sometimes a walker, and other times, as when she is in the house, she does not use any assistive device.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old female who presents status post a right revision total knee arthroplasty on October 30, 2014.  She was revised for a mid flexion instability and is approximately 2 years status post revision arthroplasty.  She was previously having a few falls due to right lower extremity weakness.  She has not had a fall since her last visit on 03/16/2016.  She does walk with a cane in her left hand when she is outside the house.  Around the house she ambulates without assistance.  She does not have any right knee pain and feels like she is doing well from a right total knee arthroplasty perspective.  She was interested in pursuing some physical therapy for right lower extremity strengthening.  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Patient denies fever, chills, sweats, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation.  PHYSICAL EXAM:  Patient is awake, alert, and oriented, in no apparent distress with nonlabored respirations and normal systemic perfusion.  She appears her stated age.  On examination of the right knee, surgical incision is clean, dry, and intact, well healed.  No signs of infection.  Range of motion 0-100 degrees.  Knee is stable to varus and valgus stress.  Negative Lachman. Negative posterior drawer.  She does ambulate slowly with a nonantalgic gait with a cane in the left hand.  IMAGING:  X-rays of the right knee obtained in clinic today do show a right constrained total knee arthroplasty, components in good position with no signs of loosening.  No fracture.  ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 77-year-old female who presents postoperatively status post right total knee arthroplasty revision for mid flexion instability.  She is about 2 years postop.  She is walking well without knee pain with a cane in the left hand.  At this point, we believe she would benefit from physical therapy for right lower extremity strengthening to prevent future falls.  We did write her a prescription for 8 weeks of physical therapy twice a week.  The patient voiced understanding and agreement to the above plan.  She will return to clinic in 3 months.  All of her questions were answered.  Dr. Gonzalez saw and examined the patient and agrees with the above assessment and plan.

A left upper extremity venogram was performed with peripheral injection of intravenous contrast dye. A patent subclavian vein was seen, with no evidence of narrowing, stenosis or dilatations. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The previous incision was infiltrated with 1% lidocaine. An incision was made over the previous incision, using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection with electrocautery the generator was removed from the pocket.  Using the modified Seldinger technique, a single venipuncture was made in the axillary vein with a cook needle.  An 0.035Â¿ guide wire was passed to the inferior vena cava and a single 9-French peel-away sheath was advanced over one of the wires.  A single 9-French peel-away sheath was advanced over the wire. The coronary sinus was cannulated, and a venogram was performed with contrast using a balloon tipped catheter in the coronary sinus. A posterior lateral vein was identified. A Model Number 4674, Serial Number 818700 LV lead was placed in a posterior lateral vein of the left ventricle, adequate pacing was confirmed, the sheath was peeled away, and the lead was sewn into position with 0 ethibond suture. Copious amounts of antibiotic solution were then used to irrigate the pocket. The boston scientific Model Number G148, Serial Number 167843 device was then connected to the leads, adequate connections of all three leads to the generator were confirmed. Appropriate sensing, pacing impedance, shock impedance, and pacing thresholds were tested and verified through the device.  Adequate hemostasis and lead placement were verified once again and then the pocket was closed with a single layer of interrupted 2.0 vicryl and a single layer of continuous 3.0 vicryl.  The skin was closed with steristrips. The patient tolerated the procedure well. A sterile pressure dressing was applied. The patientÂ¿s arm was immobilized and the patient was transferred from the lab in stable condition.

A left upper extremity venogram was performed with peripheral injection of intravenous contrast dye. A patent subclavian vein was seen, with no evidence of narrowing, stenosis or dilatations. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The previous incision was infiltrated with 1% lidocaine. An incision was made over the previous incision, using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection with electrocautery the generator was removed from the pocket.  Using the modified Seldinger technique, a single venipuncture was made in the axillary vein with a cook needle.  An 0.035"""" guide wire was passed to the inferior vena cava and a single 9-French peel-away sheath was advanced over one of the wires.  A single 9-French peel-away sheath was advanced over the wire. The coronary sinus was cannulated, and a venogram was performed with contrast using a balloon tipped catheter in the coronary sinus. A posterior lateral vein was identified. A Model Number 4674, Serial Number 818700 LV lead was placed in a posterior lateral vein of the left ventricle, adequate pacing was confirmed, the sheath was peeled away, and the lead was sewn into position with 0 ethibond suture. Copious amounts of antibiotic solution were then used to irrigate the pocket. The boston scientific Model Number G148, Serial Number 167843 device was then connected to the leads, adequate connections of all three leads to the generator were confirmed. Appropriate sensing, pacing impedance, shock impedance, and pacing thresholds were tested and verified through the device.  Adequate hemostasis and lead placement were verified once again and then the pocket was closed with a single layer of interrupted 2.0 vicryl and a single layer of continuous 3.0 vicryl.  The skin was closed with steristrips. The patient tolerated the procedure well. A sterile pressure dressing was applied. The patientÂ¿s arm was immobilized and the patient was transferred from the lab in stable condition.

Currently on surveillance.    Malignant neoplasm of uterus (CMS/HCC)  - Plan to continue q6mo visits until 7/2024, annually thereafter. This patient provides limited history and is unable to articulate subtle (if any ) symptoms. Similarly, exam is limited, and the discomfort of the exam outweighs the benefit of doing a non-specific, poorly sensitive and highly invasive pelvic exam. Accordingly, we will incorporate the use of CT imaging into her surveillance q6 months until 2022. This is consistent with NCCN guidance in patients with high risk and advanced stage endometrial cancer.    - last CT AP (NOT chest) with NED 12/02/2021; Last CT chest, abdomen, pelvis performed 2/2020. Will plan for next scan June 2022, to include chest, abdomen and pelvis.    - Will schedule in clinic follow-up in June following her CT scan (chest, abdomen, pelvis).    Schizoaffective disorder (CMS/HCC)  Mood and affect is more positive today than usual. However, ability to obtain history is still quite limited.  Have adapted surveillance strategy accordingly.      Shannon MacLaughlan, MD,   Patient seen and discussed with Dr. MacLaughlan    Attending attestation: I saw this  patient with the student, and personally conducted a history and physical exam. The above note reflects the student's documentation of the patient's history, which has been edited it as appropriate. Medical decision making documented here reflects a shared-decision making model between myself and the patient directly.       "

ATTENDING SURGEON:  Jeanna Park, MD.  RESIDENTS:  Clare Harney, MD. Rachel Harrison, MD.  FINDINGS:  Bimanual exam:  Unable to palpate uterine size or cervix secondary to body habitus.  Hysteroscopic findings:  Uterus sounded to 12 cm.  1 cm endocervical polyp removed and sent to Pathology.  3-4 cm  endometrial polyp removed and sent to Pathology.  SPECIMENS REMOVED:  Endometrial polyp, endocervical polyp, endometrial curettings.  ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  5 mL.  MEDICATIONS ADMINISTERED:  See anesthesia record.  BLOOD AND BLOOD COMPONENTS ADMINISTERED:  None.  COMPLICATIONS:  None.  IV FLUIDS:  450 mL of crystalloid.  HYSTEROSCOPIC FLUID DEFICIT:  880 mL of normal saline.  URINE OUTPUT:  200 mL of clear yellow urine at the beginning of the procedure via straight catheterization.  DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was moved to the operating room, where spinal anesthesia was administered.  She was then prepped and draped in typical sterile fashion in dorsal lithotomy position.  The bladder was drained of urine.  A large bivalve speculum was introduced into the patient's vagina, and the cervix was visualized at the back of the vagina.  A single-tooth tenaculum was placed on the anterior lip of the cervix, and the cervix was found to have no descent.  The cervix was dilated, and the hysteroscope was advanced through the cervix and into the uterus.  Given the patient's long vagina with no cervical descent and enlarged uterus, the hysteroscope was only able to be advanced just past the internal cervical os.  Polyp was visualized, and decision was made to proceed with the resectoscope.  This was advanced through the cervix and into the uterus.  The cervical polyp was resected, and then secondary to difficulty with visualizing the uterus given the short length of the scope relative to the patient's habitus, the bivalve speculum was removed, and the scope was advanced through the vagina into the cervix under direct visualization.  Once adequate visualization of the uterine polyp was achieved, the resectoscope was used to resect the uterine polyp in stages. The chips were removed using the resectoscope and also with a sharp curettage. A sharp curettage was less effective secondary again to the patient's habitus. Once the entire polyp was removed under direct visualization, the uterus was again photographed.  Please note that we were unable to see all the way up to the fundus, and everything visible within the limits of our equipment in the operating room had been removed from the uterus.  All instruments were removed from the vagina.  The cervix was found to be hemostatic.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was moved to the recovery room in stable condition.  All sponge, lap, and instrument counts were correct.  Dr. Park was present, scrubbed, and supervised the entire procedure.

The pt has had post menopausal bleeding (PMB) since 2008-2009, at which time she underwent an endometrial bx that returned benign.  The bleeding then ceased after 2009, and returned in 2012.  She underwent anther endometiral bx 2012 that the pt reports as being an uncomfortable and difficult procedure due to the bed being too little.  Thus, the results were inconclusive because only a small sample was retreived.  The pt has recently complained of PMB again and was seen by her gynecologist, Dr. Robinson,  (12/16/13) to disucss her pelvic US (10/30/13) results that showed an endometrial polyp.  Dr. Robinson discussed doing preoperative endometrial sampling with the pt, but she refused because of her last experience.  The pt's gynecologist explained that it can be done surgically, but that she may need to go for another surgical procedure if the results of the bx return malignant.  The pt stated that she understood the conditions and still preferred not to do the preoperative sampling.  Pt is scheduled to have a Dx H/S, polypectomy and D&C 2/14/14 at 8am.  The pt is otherwise doing well today.  She is still using her Nonstep bike for 20-30mins/day along with walking laps in her residental hallways and seeing her dietician regularly.  She is still complaining of constipation but reports that it is better with the fiber gummies +Vit D she is taking now.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is a 63-year-old female with bilateral knee pain and morbid obesity for the last 15 years.  We last saw her in clinic approximately 1 year ago, in which she was given the Synvisc injection to both of her knees.  She states that these injections did not help at all and lasted only approximately 45 minutes.  She has been doing physical therapy in the past, particularly water exercise.  She also states she has been trying to exercise every Monday through Saturday mainly consisting of walking down a couple of hallways or biking.  In the last couple of months or so, she states this pain has been getting worse and more frequent and more severe.  She is having increasing pain while walking, while trying to stand up, as well as sitting down.  Her exercise time has decreased due to the excess pain. At this time last year, she weighed approximately 430 pounds and today she does weigh 415 pounds so she has only lost 15 pounds in the last 1 year.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On exam, the patient is alert and oriented x3.  She is morbidly obese.  She is able to fully extend both her knees and can flex both to approximately 110 degrees. She is stable to varus, valgus stress.  Neurovascularly intact distally.  ASSEMENT AND PLAN: The patient is a 63-year-old female with bilateral knee DJD.  Even though she did not have improvement with the Synvisc injections last year, we will go ahead and proceed with bilateral corticosteroid injections to both of her knees.  Lidocaine 3 cc and 1 cc of 40 mg Kenalog were drawn up in an 18-gauge needle.  The injection sites were sterilely prepped.  This mixture was injected using a 25-gauge needle in the superolateral area of the knee. Hemostasis was achieved following the procedures.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  No complications noted.  She did have immediate pain relief after these injections.  In addition to these injections, we will give her a prescription for physical therapy with ATI for her to start up again.  We also encouraged her for weight loss in order for her to have any chance of knee replacement surgery in the future.  The patient expressed understanding of above assessment and plan.  All questions were answered.  We would like to see this patient back in 6 months' time.  Dr. Chmell, who saw and examined the patient, agrees with the above.

Endometrium was fragmented at surgery, however there is concern for ongoing proliferative endometrium.   Given patient's obesity and bleeding, pt likely has excess estrogen production contributing to irregular bleeding and possibly recurrent polyp formation. Called and discussed results with pt as well as recommendation for Progestin maintenance. Would recommend starting with Provera 10mg daily x2weeks then stopping so pt has a chance to slough off endometrial lining. After withdrawl bleed, would restart Provera and continue daily for maintenance. At this time, pt is unsure of whether she would like to start this since she reports her bleeding has resolved.

INDICATION: cough; 95-year-old male with history of hypertension and borderline diabetes presenting with generalized weakness, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea  TECHNIQUE: Frontal chest radiographs are submitted for interpretation.  FINDINGS: Evaluation is limited by rotation. The cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess secondary to rotation and technique. There are bibasilar interstitial and airspace opacities. Right upper lobe lucency suggestive of bullous emphysematous disease. No pneumothorax. There are degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.  IMPRESSION: 1.

DATE:   5/5/2019 1:38 PM  INDICATION: AMS; 95-year-old male  COMPARISON: None available  TECHNIQUE: Volumetric images of the head were obtained in a routine fashion. Axial, coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.  FINDINGS:  The ventricles and sulci are symmetrically enlarged, likely age-related changes. The gray-white junction is distinct without evidence for acute infarction. The ventricles are symmetric and normal in both shape and volume, without evidence for hydrocephalus. Basal cisterns and cortical sulci are symmetric and not effaced. There are hypodensities in the region of the left basal ganglia that may represent age-indeterminate lacunar infarcts versus dilated perivascular spaces. The study is negative for intracranial hemorrhage or space occupying lesion. The brainstem and cerebellum are normal.  The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well pneumatized. The skull base appears unremarkable.    IMPRESSION: 1. Noncontrast CT of the head is negative for an acute intracranial abnormality. 2. Left basal ganglia hypodensities that may represent age-indeterminate lacunar infarcts versus dilated perivascular spaces.  ****************** Preliminary report issued by Dr. B. A.

Diffuse cerebral parenchymal volume loss. Slight asymmetric enlargement of the left sylvian fissure anteriorly which might be secondary to encephalomalacia at the left superior temporal region incompletely assessed by this study.   Xray abdomen 5/5/19: Single view of the upper abdomen and lower chest demonstrates Dobbhoff catheter. The tip is just below the diaphragm, probably near the gastric cardia. Suggest advancement. Nonobstructive bowel gas pattern is noted. The lungs are hyperexpanded, suspicious for COPD. Much of the cardiac shadow is to the right of midline, probably related to volume loss in the right hemithorax. In addition, the right hemidiaphragm is obscured likely secondary to atelectasis and/or consolidation. Situs inversus is thought to be less likely. There is consolidation at the left lung base, as well.  Subjective: Pt seen at bedside, does not fully arouse for assessment.  Name and DOB provided by wrist band.

I agree with the evaluation and management plans which reflect our discussions.  My clinical impression and assessment is included below.  95 year old M with PMHx of HTN and preDM who was admitted from ED with complaints of generalized weakness, nausea, diarrhea and noted to have AMS by family. On admission he was found to hypotensive, hypernatremic, with PNA (flu positive), acidosis (lactic) and an AKI as well as Afib with RVR and likely demand ischemia. Patient is currently s/p fluid resuscitation and broad spectrum antibiotics, he is awake and more alert, maintaining his airway, and saturating adequately on high flow NC. Anticoagulation was initiated given that duration of Afib was unknown and there was concern for possible cardioversion yesterday. He will remain on heparin drip for now based on cardiology recs.

I agree with the evaluation and management plans which reflect our discussions.  My clinical impression and assessment is included below.  95 year old M with PMHx of HTN and preDM who was admitted from ED with complaints of generalized weakness, nausea, diarrhea and noted to have AMS by family. On admission he was found to hypotensive, hypernatremic, with PNA (flu positive), acidosis (lactic) and an AKI as well as Afib with RVR and likely demand ischemia. Patient is currently s/p fluid resuscitation and broad spectrum antibiotics. Troponins and lactic acid are downtrending, AKI is improving.   Today he is awake, alert, AAOx1-2, maintaining his airway, with decreased FiO2 needs to maintain sats. He was transiently hypercapneic overnight - repeat ABG showed improvement in pCO2. Anticoagulation was initiated given that duration of Afib, afib is currently rate controlled. He will remain on heparin drip for now based on cardiology recs. Continue other supportive measures as outlined in house officerÂ¿s note.   Dx:   AMS, AKI, acidosis, PNA, influenza positive, hypernatremia/hypovolemia, type II NSTEMI, Afib with RVR.

Per wife, the patient had diarrhea, poor appetite, no vomiting, + nausea for two days. The wife states he went to sleep last night and woke up in the same position and not responding so EMS was called. He has not seen a physician in over 2 years and does not take any medication. Family deny noticing weakness on one side, facial dropping, slurred speech, etc. Patient is hard of hearing.  He has had low appetite and has not had anything to eat in 3-4 days.  Pt A&Ox1 and unable to answer questions. On admission family denies cp, abd pain. He is independent at home.   ED Course:  Initial EKG with HR 134, no st elevation/depression, Qtc 397, NSR (although computer reports Aflutter, p waves are visible). Patient febrile, tachycardic, likely septic. Labs with hypernatremia, lactic acidosis, elevated LFTs, Cr elevation, troponin elevation. U/A without LE or nitrites, mild WBC elevation. CXR with multifocal pneumonia and influenza positive. Patient given azithromycin and ceftriaxone, rectal tylenol, IVF. Unable to give oral tamiflu because of poor swallowing, needs swallow eval, no IV or rectal form. O2 sat was difficult to obtain, placed on 3L NC,. VBG with hypercarbia, acidosis - ABG with O2 sat 87%. Patient likely tachypneic secondary to sepsis and pneumonia. Bedside US of abdomen to evaluate for possible ascending cholangitis but no significant GB wall thickening or gallstones. EKG and troponin discussd with cardiology fellow, no further recs at this time. Admitted to MICU initially planned on continuous BiPAP.  MICU Course (5/5-5/8):  On admission, Pt hypotensive, w/ Cr of 3.2, and lactic acidosis of 3.7 improved/responded to bolus hydration. Pt was started on azithromycin and ceftriaxone for CAP, and oseltamivir for influenzae. Pt transitioned to HFNC 50L 50% FiO2 because he had an episode of emesis on BiPAP. Furthermore, he was started on chest PT during the day, frequent nasal sunctioning and CPAP at night. Given hypercapnia on CPAP, Pt was switched to HFNC 40L FiO2 30%, w/ BiPAP at night 12/7 30%, which he tolerated well. His mentation improved, now AAO*1 and responsive. Remained afebrile, no leukocytosis, no diarrhea during stay.  With regard to his aflutter and elevated troponin. Pt received aspirin LD and started on heparin gtt, which was discontinued after Cardiolgy confirmed no plan for intervention. Pt since was rate controlled on metoprolol 6.25 q12hr -->12,5 q12hr to achieve HR<100.  Speech evaluated the Pt, recomended Dobhoff placement for tubefeed as Pt failed swallowing eval. Nutrition consulted and made rec with regard to tubefeeding.  On the day of transfer, Pt VSS, afebrile. Weaned down from HFNC to NC 6L without desaturation. No f/c/n/v, CP or SOB. Furthermore, his suctioning need down adjusted from q1-2hrs to needing q4hr and prn. At this point Pt was deemed stable to transfer to floor for continuation of care.

ED Course:  Initial EKG with HR 134, no st elevation/depression, Qtc 397, NSR (although computer reports Aflutter, p waves are visible). Patient febrile, tachycardic, likely septic. Labs with hypernatremia, lactic acidosis, elevated LFTs, Cr elevation, troponin elevation. U/A without LE or nitrites, mild WBC elevation. CXR with multifocal pneumonia and influenza positive. Patient given azithromycin and ceftriaxone, rectal tylenol, IVF. Unable to give oral tamiflu because of poor swallowing, needs swallow eval, no IV or rectal form. O2 sat was difficult to obtain, placed on 3L NC,. VBG with hypercarbia, acidosis - ABG with O2 sat 87%. Patient likely tachypneic secondary to sepsis and pneumonia. Bedside US of abdomen to evaluate for possible ascending cholangitis but no significant GB wall thickening or gallstones. EKG and troponin discussd with cardiology fellow, no further recs at this time. Admitted to MICU initially planned on continuous BiPAP.  MICU Course (5/5-5/8):  On admission, Pt hypotensive, w/ Cr of 3.2, and lactic acidosis of 3.7 improved/responded to bolus hydration. Pt was started on azithromycin and ceftriaxone for CAP, and oseltamivir for influenzae. Pt transitioned to HFNC 50L 50% FiO2 because he had an episode of emesis on BiPAP. Furthermore, he was started on chest PT during the day, frequent nasal sunctioning and CPAP at night. Given hypercapnia on CPAP, Pt was switched to HFNC 40L FiO2 30%, w/ BiPAP at night 12/7 30%, which he tolerated well. His mentation improved, now AAO*1 and responsive. Remained afebrile, no leukocytosis, no diarrhea during stay.  With regard to his aflutter and elevated troponin. Pt received aspirin LD and started on heparin gtt, which was discontinued after Cardiolgy confirmed no plan for intervention. Pt since was rate controlled on metoprolol 6.25 q12hr -->12,5 q12hr to achieve HR<100.  Speech evaluated the Pt, recomended Dobhoff placement for tubefeed as Pt failed swallowing eval. Nutrition consulted and made rec with regard to tubefeeding.  On the day of transfer, Pt VSS, afebrile. Weaned down from HFNC to NC 6L without desaturation. No f/c/n/v, CP or SOB. Furthermore, his suctioning need down adjusted from q1-2hrs to needing q4hr and prn. At this point Pt was deemed stable to transfer to floor for continuation of care.  Subjective:  Patient still boarding in MICU. He appears comfortable laying in bed. TF's running at goal and he is tolerating them well. When awoken, he is seems confused about where he is but in NAD. Nontachycardic, BP 140/80's. Satting well on 4LNC.

Pt was started on azithromycin and ceftriaxone for CAP, and oseltamivir for influenzae. Pt transitioned to HFNC 50L 50% FiO2 because he had an episode of emesis on BiPAP. Furthermore, he was started on chest PT during the day, frequent nasal sunctioning and CPAP at night. Given hypercapnia on CPAP, Pt was switched to HFNC 40L FiO2 30%, w/ BiPAP at night 12/7 30%, which he tolerated well. His mentation improved, now AAO*1 and responsive. Remained afebrile, no leukocytosis, no diarrhea during stay.  With regard to his aflutter and elevated troponin. Pt received aspirin LD and started on heparin gtt, which was discontinued after Cardiolgy confirmed no plan for intervention. Pt since was rate controlled on metoprolol 6.25 q12hr -->12,5 q12hr to achieve HR<100.  Speech evaluated the Pt, recomended Dobhoff placement for tubefeed as Pt failed swallowing eval. Nutrition consulted and made rec with regard to tubefeeding.  On the day of transfer, Pt VSS, afebrile. Weaned down from HFNC to NC 6L without desaturation. No f/c/n/v, CP or SOB. Furthermore, his suctioning need down adjusted from q1-2hrs to needing q4hr and prn. At this point Pt was deemed stable to transfer to floor for continuation of care.  Team A Course (5/8 - 5/14): Discussed patient's care with wife and family. Disucssed current condition and his state prior to coming to the hospital (pt with advanced dementia). They decided that it would be in patient's best interest to continue with comfort directed care. Palliative care was consulted and they recommended hospice referral with the family's confirmation. Unecessary medications were discontinued. Patient is currently on BiPAP at night for hypercapnea. This can be discontinued at hospice as he cannot be on night BiPAP. Can use 2-4L O2 via NC for comfort. He is receiving PO augmentin for pneumomia and will be done with a course on 5/15 PM. He is s/p tamiflu and azithro.   Patient accepted to Hospice at SAR. Family at bedside on day of transfer. Patient receiving pleasure feeds as family did not want G-Tube prior to hospice decision.

I explained to the patient and her mom that the ectopic beats are usually benign and the fact that they disappear with exercise was reassuring.I think she has an element of anxiety that precipate some of her chest pain symptoms, however given the family history of cardiomyopathy will recommend further testing to complete her evaluation .  cbc, thyroid and chemistry labs done by PCP- WNL  RECOMMENDATIONS: Reassurance Testing: EST with possible holter monitor SBE: not indicated activity limitations: she is cleared to exercise with self limited activity.

Fetal biometry consistent with assigned EDC as above. Detailed anatomy survey performed. Fetal anatomy was adequately visualized and appeared normal. No fetal anomalies were identified. Cervical length is normal, without evidence of funneling.  4/3/19 fetal echo:  Impression =========  Normal fetal cardiac echo within the limits of the study. (Due to fetal circulation patterns, small atrial and ventricular septal defects, mild valvular abnormalities, minor pulmonary and systemic vein abnormalities, and coarctation of the aorta may not be apparent on fetal exam). Echo drop off seen at the top of the ventricular septum, but the ventricular septum from other projections appear intact.   Follow-up ========  No further follow-up requested.   Electronically signed by Vithida Sueblinvong, MD on 2019/04/03 14:26     2/21/19 Genetics Consult: CVS and amniocentesis and the benefits and limitations of diagnostic testing, including the risk of miscarriage associated with the procedures. The option of pregnancy termination up to 24 weeks in Illinois was also discussed. We reviewed that normal genetic screening/diagnostic testing cannot guarantee a normal pregnancy outcome and that every pregnancy has a 3-5% risk for birth defect/intellectual disability. The patient elected to proceed with cell free DNA screening at today's visit. She understands the limitations of cell-free DNA screening in that it is not diagnostic and does not screen for all genetic conditions that may be associated with an increased NT measurement. She also understand that amniocentesis can be performed >15 weeks gestation up until delivery.  We reviewed that ultrasound is another screening tool and that anatomy scan is typically performed between ~18-22 weeks gestation and that this can be used to screen for soft signs of fetal aneuploidy as well as certain structural abnormalities. We discussed that ultrasound is not diagnostic and cannot be used to definitively diagnose or rule out fetal aneuploidy.   We discussed the option of expanded carrier screening through Counsyl's UIC panel. We discussed the purpose of carrier screening and reviewed autosomal recessive inheritance. We discussed that if both partners in a couple are carriers for the same condition, there is a 25% chance for an affected pregnancy, and briefly reviewed the option of prenatal diagnostic testing. The patient declined carrier screening  today.  She understands that this can be performed at any point during or after pregnancy.   Impression/Plan: 1. The patient was seen today to discuss an increased NT (3.4mm) identified on ultrasound today. 2. The patient elected to proceed with cell free DNA screening at today's visit. The patient understands that this is screening and NOT diagnostic for T21, T13, T18 and sex chromosome aneuploidy. She declined diagnostic testing at today's visit. Results are expected in 7-10 days. 3. The patient declined expanded carrier screening at today's visit. 4. We spent 35 minutes in direct counseling and education with the patient and her partner today.

Current Pregnancy: LMP: 11/27/18 EDD: 8/28/19 Age at delivery: 22yo GA: 13w1d Singleton: Yes  The patient denies exposures in the current pregnancy, including alcohol, drugs, tobacco use.   Family History:   Maternal ancestry: Northern European Paternal ancestry: Northern European Consanguinity: denied  Discussion: The patient was seen in consult today to discuss an increased NT measurement of 3.4mm. We discussed that an increased NT measurement on ultrasound is seen in approximately 5% of first trimester ultrasound, and can be a normal variant, but also can indicate an increased risk for abnormal pregnancy outcome, includuing chromosome abnormalities, copy number variants, single gene disorders (such as Noonan), structural abnormality (especially cardiac). We discussed that the risk for abnormal pregnancy outcomes is associated with the size of the NT measurement, and that this risk increases as the NT thickness increases. We discussed that based on an NT measurement of 3.4mm, the risk for chromosomal abnormalities is ~7.1% (Kagan et al., Obstet Gynecol 2006;107:6Â¿10). We reviewed chromosomes and chromosome abnormalities. We discussed the clinical features of some of the more common chromosome abnormalities, including trisomy 21, 18, and 13.   We discussed the patient's options including cell free DNA screening, diagnostic testing through CVS or amniocentesis, as well as no testing. We discussed in detail the difference between screening and diagnostic testing. We discussed that cell free DNA screening is a test that screens for trisomy 13, 18 and 21 and sex chromosome aneuploidy and is NOT diagnostic. The benefits and limiations of cell-free DNA screening were reviewed. The patient and her partner were counseled that prenatal diagnosis for fetal aneuploidy is available through CVS or amniocentesis. We discussed the differences between CVS and amniocentesis and the benefits and limitations of diagnostic testing, including the risk of miscarriage associated with the procedures. The option of pregnancy termination up to 24 weeks in Illinois was also discussed. We reviewed that normal genetic screening/diagnostic testing cannot guarantee a normal pregnancy outcome and that every pregnancy has a 3-5% risk for birth defect/intellectual disability. The patient elected to proceed with cell free DNA screening at today's visit. She understands the limitations of cell-free DNA screening in that it is not diagnostic and does not screen for all genetic conditions that may be associated with an increased NT measurement. She also understand that amniocentesis can be performed >15 weeks gestation up until delivery.  We reviewed that ultrasound is another screening tool and that anatomy scan is typically performed between ~18-22 weeks gestation and that this can be used to screen for soft signs of fetal aneuploidy as well as certain structural abnormalities. We discussed that ultrasound is not diagnostic and cannot be used to definitively diagnose or rule out fetal aneuploidy.   We discussed the option of expanded carrier screening through Counsyl's UIC panel. We discussed the purpose of carrier screening and reviewed autosomal recessive inheritance. We discussed that if both partners in a couple are carriers for the same condition, there is a 25% chance for an affected pregnancy, and briefly reviewed the option of prenatal diagnostic testing. The patient declined carrier screening  today.  She understands that this can be performed at any point during or after pregnancy.   Impression/Plan: 1. The patient was seen today to discuss an increased NT (3.4mm) identified on ultrasound today. 2. The patient elected to proceed with cell free DNA screening at today's visit. The patient understands that this is screening and NOT diagnostic for T21, T13, T18 and sex chromosome aneuploidy. She declined diagnostic testing at today's visit. Results are expected in 7-10 days. 3. The patient declined expanded carrier screening at today's visit. 4. We spent 35 minutes in direct counseling and education with the patient and her partner today.  Madelyn Katz Genetic Counselor"

Her mother was present at today's visit and reports that the baby was born prematurely and that there was also a power outage at the hospital and that the baby died in transport. She denies any birth defects and reports that no genetic etiology was susepcted. The couple otherwise deny a family history of birth defects, infant deaths, intellectual disability, genetic disorders and 3+ miscarriages."

The patient was counseled that this is a screening test and NOT diagnostic for these conditions. We reviewed again her abnormal ultrasound finding of an increased NT. We discused that this normal screening test reduces the chances of one of these more common chromosome abnormalities, but does not rule out the possibility. We also discussed in detail that there are many other genetic conditions that are associated with an abnormal NT measurement, including other chromosome abnormalities, microdeletions/duplications and genetic syndromes, such as Noonan. We also discussed that abnormal NT measurements are associated with an increased risk for heart defects and other structural fetal abnormalities. The patient verbalized understanding of this information. We discussed that diagnostic testing can be performed through amniocentesis after 15 weeks up until delivery, and patient verbalized understanding, and declined diagnostic testing on the phone today. We also discussed that a detailed anatomy scan can be performed between ~18-22 weeks gestation to evaluate for fetal structural abnormalities. Predicted female fetal sex was also revealed by patient request. All questions answered. The patient will follow up with any further questions.  Madelyn Katz Genetic Counselor"

As you recall, she is a 22 year-old G1P0, currently at 28w6d with an established EDC of 8/28/19, who was referred to my attention due to a history of abnormal NT of 3.4mm, to discuss this history and to develop a plan for pregnancy surveillance.    Ultrasound was also accomplished today that confirmed dates.  No anomalies were identified. Please see separate report for ultrasound details.     In Brief: Patient has met with genetics and has had a low risk cfDNA. She was counseled on amniocentesis being diagnostic and she declines. she was counseled on risks of amnio as well including pprom, ptd, infection, bleeding. she understands that the tests she has had so far are screening, but that the cfDNA has a 99% chance ofo detecting T21. Her anatomy scan was normal. Her fetal echo was also normal. Her US today showed appropriate growth and fluid.    Of note, recommend Tdap in the third trimester. 3TM labs were ordered today. 1 hr glucola was WNL  All the questions were answered.   I answered numerous well informed questions by this delightful patient.   Thank you very much for your referral of this most pleasant patient.  Please do not hesitate to call me with any questions or concerns regarding this patient.   Thank you very much.    Katherine Cotangco, DO, PGY3 Seen with DR. Buhimschi MFM attending"

Blood clots in these veins need to be treated because they can get bigger, break loose, and travel through the bloodstream to the lungs. A blood clot in a lung can be life-threatening.  The doctor may have given you a blood thinner (anticoagulant). A blood thinner can stop the blood clot from growing larger and prevent new clots from forming. You will need to take a blood thinner for at least 3 months.  The doctor has checked you carefully, but problems can develop later. If you notice any problems or new symptoms, get medical treatment right away.  Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety. Be sure to make and go to all appointments, and call your doctor if you are having problems. It's also a good idea to know your test results and keep a list of the medicines you take.  How can you care for yourself at home?  Â¿Â¿ Take your medicines exactly as prescribed. Call your doctor if you think you are having a problem with your medicine.  Â¿Â¿ If you are taking a blood thinner, be sure you get instructions about how to take your medicine safely. Blood thinners can cause serious bleeding problems.  Â¿Â¿ Try to walk several times a day.  Â¿Â¿ Wear compression stockings if your doctor recommends them. These stockings are tighter at the feet than on the legs. They may reduce pain and swelling in your legs. But there are different types of stockings, and they need to fit right. So your doctor will recommend what you need.  Â¿Â¿ When you sit, use a pillow to raise the arm or leg that has the blood clot. Try to keep it above the level of your heart.  When should you call for help?   Call 911 anytime you think you may need emergency care. For example, call if:  Â¿Â¿ Â¿Â¿ You passed out (lost consciousness).   Â¿Â¿ Â¿Â¿ You have symptoms of a blood clot in your lung (called a pulmonary  embolism). These include:  ? Sudden chest pain.  ? Trouble breathing.  ? Coughing up blood.   Call your doctor now or seek immediate medical care if:  Â¿Â¿ Â¿Â¿ You have new or worse trouble breathing.   Â¿Â¿ Â¿Â¿ You are dizzy or lightheaded, or you feel like you may faint.   Â¿Â¿ Â¿Â¿ You have symptoms of a blood clot in your arm or leg. These may include:  ? Pain in the arm, calf, back of the knee, thigh, or groin.  ? Redness and swelling in the arm, leg, or groin.   Watch closely for changes in your health, and be sure to contact your doctor if:  Â¿Â¿ Â¿Â¿ You do not get better as expected.   Where can you learn more?

Infection After Surgery: Care Instructions  Your Care Instructions  After surgery, an infection is always possible. It doesn't mean that the surgery didn't go well.  Because an infection can be serious, your doctor has taken steps to manage it.  Your doctor checked the infection and cleaned it if necessary. He or she may have made an opening in the area so that the pus can drain out. You may have gauze in the cut so that the area will stay open and keep draining. You may need antibiotics.  You will need to follow up with your doctor to make sure the infection has gone away.  Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety. Be sure to make and go to all appointments, and call your doctor if you are having problems. It's also a good idea to know your test results and keep a list of the  medicines you take.  How can you care for yourself at home?  Â¿Â¿ Make sure your surgeon knows that you saw a doctor about the infection.  Â¿Â¿ If your doctor prescribed antibiotics, take them as directed. Do not stop taking them just because you feel better. You need to take the full course of antibiotics.  Â¿Â¿ Ask your doctor if you can take an over-the-counter pain medicine, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve). Be safe with medicines. Read and follow all instructions on the label.  Â¿Â¿ Do not take two or more pain medicines at the same time unless the doctor told you to. Many pain medicines have acetaminophen, which is Tylenol. Too much acetaminophen (Tylenol) can be harmful.  Â¿Â¿ Prop up the area on a pillow anytime you sit or lie down during the next 3 days. Try to keep it above the level of your heart. This will help reduce swelling.  Â¿Â¿ Keep the skin clean and dry.  Â¿Â¿ If you have a bandage, keep it clean and dry.  Â¿Â¿ You may have a dressing over the cut (incision). A dressing helps the incision heal and protects it. Your doctor will tell you how to take care of this. You can expect drainage from the wound.  Â¿Â¿ If your doctor told you how to care for your incision, follow your doctor's instructions. If you did not get instructions, follow this general advice:  ? Wash around the incision with clean water 2 times a day. Don't use hydrogen peroxide or alcohol, which can slow healing.  When should you call for help?   Call your doctor now or seek immediate medical care if:  Â¿Â¿ Â¿Â¿ You have signs that your infection is getting worse, such as:  ? Increased pain, swelling, warmth, or redness in the area.  ? Red streaks leading from the area.  ? Pus draining from the wound.  ? A new or higher fever.   Watch closely for changes in your health, and be sure to contact your doctor if you have any problems.

Acute Pain After Surgery: Care Instructions  Your Care Instructions     It's common to have some pain after surgery. Pain doesn't mean that something is wrong or that the surgery didn't go well. But when the pain is severe, it's important to work with your doctor to manage it. It's also important to be aware of a few facts about pain and pain medicine.  Â¿Â¿ You are the only person who knows what your pain feels like. So be sure to tell your doctor when you are in pain or when the pain changes. Then he or she will know how to adjust your medicines.  Â¿Â¿ Pain is often easier to control right after it starts. So it may be better to take regular doses of pain medicine and not wait until the pain gets bad.  Â¿Â¿ Medicine can help control pain. But this doesn't mean you'll have no pain. Medicine works to keep the pain at a level you can live with. With time, you will feel better.  Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety. Be sure to make and go to all appointments, and call your doctor if you are having problems. It's also a good idea to know your test results and keep a list of the medicines you take.  How can you care for yourself at home?  Â¿Â¿ Be safe with medicines. Read and follow all instructions on the label.  ? If the doctor gave you a prescription medicine for pain, take it as prescribed.  ? If you are not taking a prescription pain medicine, ask your doctor if you can take an over-the-counter medicine.  Â¿Â¿ If you take an over-the-counter pain  medicine, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve), read and follow all instructions on the label.  Â¿Â¿ Do not take two or more pain medicines at the same time unless the doctor told you to.  Â¿Â¿ Do not drink alcohol while you are taking pain medicines.  Â¿Â¿ Try to walk each day if your doctor recommends it. Start by walking a little more than you did the day before. Bit by bit, increase the amount you walk. Walking increases blood flow. It also helps prevent pneumonia and constipation.  Â¿Â¿ To prevent constipation from opioid pain medicines:  ? Talk to your doctor about a laxative.

It replaced your cloudy natural lens with a clear artificial one.  After surgery, your eye will not hurt. But it may feel scratchy, sticky, or uncomfortable. It may also water more than usual.  Most people see better 1 to 3 days after surgery. But it could take 3 to 10 weeks to get the full benefits of surgery and to see as clearly as possible.  Your doctor may send you home with a bandage, patch, or clear shield on your eye. This will keep you from rubbing your eye. Your doctor will also give you eyedrops to help your eye heal. Use them exactly as directed.  You can read or watch TV right away, but things may look blurry. Most people are able to return to work or their normal routine in 1 to 3 days. After your eye heals, you may still need to wear glasses, especially for reading.  This care sheet gives you a general idea about how long it will take for you to recover. But each person recovers at a different pace. Follow the steps below to get better as quickly as possible.  How can you care for yourself at home?  Activity  Â¿Â¿ Â¿Â¿ Rest when you feel tired. Getting enough sleep will help you recover.   Â¿Â¿ Â¿Â¿ You may have trouble judging distances for a few days. Move slowly, and be careful going up and down stairs and pouring hot liquids. Ask for help if you need it.   Â¿Â¿ Â¿Â¿ Ask your doctor when it is okay to drive.   Â¿Â¿ Â¿Â¿ Wear your eye bandage, patch, or shield for as long as your doctor recommends. You may only need to wear it when you sleep.   Â¿Â¿ Â¿Â¿ You can shower or wash your hair the day after surgery. Keep water, soap, shampoo, hair spray, and shaving lotion out of your eye, especially for the first week.   Â¿Â¿ Â¿Â¿ Do not rub or put pressure on your eye for at least 1 week.   Â¿Â¿ Â¿Â¿ Do not wear eye makeup for 1 to 2 weeks. You may also want to avoid face cream or lotion.   Â¿Â¿ Â¿Â¿ Do not get your hair colored or permed for 10 days after surgery.   Â¿Â¿ Â¿Â¿ Do not bend over or do any strenuous activities, such as biking, jogging, weight  lifting, or aerobic exercise, for 2 weeks or until your doctor says it is okay.   Â¿Â¿ Â¿Â¿ Avoid swimming, hot tubs, gardening, and dusting for 1 to 2 weeks.   Â¿Â¿ Â¿Â¿ Wear sunglasses on bright days for at least 1 year after surgery.   Medicines  Â¿Â¿ Â¿Â¿ Your doctor will tell you if and when you can restart your medicines. He or she will also give you instructions about taking any new medicines.   Â¿Â¿ Â¿Â¿ If you take aspirin or some other blood thinner, ask your doctor if and when to start taking it again. Make sure that you understand exactly what your doctor wants you to do.   Â¿Â¿ Â¿Â¿ Follow your doctor's instructions for when to use your eyedrops. Always wash your hands before you put your drops in. To put in eyedrops:  ? Tilt your head back, and pull your lower eyelid down with one finger.  ? Drop or squirt the medicine inside the lower lid.  ? Close your eye for 30 to 60 seconds to let the drops or ointment move around.  ? Do not touch the ointment or dropper tip to your eyelashes or any other surface.   Â¿Â¿ Â¿Â¿ Follow your doctor's instructions for taking pain medicines.   Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety. Be sure to make and go to all appointments, and call your doctor if you are having problems. It's also a good idea to know your test results and keep a list of the medicines you take.  When should you call for help?   Call 911 anytime you think you may need emergency care. For example, call if:  Â¿Â¿ Â¿Â¿ You passed out (lost consciousness).   Â¿Â¿ Â¿Â¿ You have a sudden loss of vision.   Â¿Â¿ Â¿Â¿ You have sudden chest pain, are short of breath, or cough up blood.   Call your doctor now or seek immediate medical care if:  Â¿Â¿ Â¿Â¿ You have signs of an eye infection, such as:  ? Pus or thick discharge coming from the eye.  ? Redness or swelling around the eye.  ? A fever.   Â¿Â¿ Â¿Â¿ You have new or worse eye pain.   Â¿Â¿ Â¿Â¿ You have vision changes.   Â¿Â¿ Â¿Â¿ You have symptoms of a blood clot in your leg (called a deep vein thrombosis), such  as:  ? Pain in the calf, back of the knee, thigh, or groin.  ? Redness and swelling in your leg or groin.   Watch closely for changes in your health, and be sure to contact your doctor if:  Â¿Â¿ Â¿Â¿ You do not get better as expected.

Procedure:           The patient was greeted in the preoperative holding area and the right eye was marked as the appropriate operative site.  The risks, benefits, alternatives, and techniques were discussed with the patient and length and the patient gave full informed consent to the procedure.  Specific attention was given to the risks of posterior capsule rupture requiring anterior vitrectomy, retained lens fragments, potential need for further surgery, potential need for postoperative refractive error, loss of vision, and even loss of eye.  The patient expressed full understanding.                                                                  The patient was brought into the operating room suite and identified by nursing. A drop of tetracaine was placed in the right eye followed by a drop of Betadine 5%. A surgical time-out was performed confirming the surgery to be performed, site of surgery, and the IOL implant chosen. The patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for surgery in the right eye. A nasal lid speculum was then placed in the right eye. A corneal paracentesis was created using a  slit-knife. This was followed by injection of non-preserved lidocaine, sterile air, trypan blue, balanced salt solution, and viscoelastic. A 2.4 mm keratome was used to make a temporal clear cornea cataract incision. A continuous tear capsulorrhexis was performed using a bent cystitome and Utrata forceps. Balanced salt solution was used to hydrodissect the lens. The lens was freely mobile. The phacoemulsifcation machine was used to remove the nucleus in a """"stop and chop"""" fashion. The cortex was removed with the irrigating/aspirating system through. Viscoelastic was placed in the capsular bag and the anterior chamber in preparation for lens insertion. An Alcon model SN60WF posterior chamber intraocular lens of was placed into the capsular bag without difficulty. The viscoelastic was removed with the irrigation/aspiration system. Balanced salt solution was used to inflate the anterior chamber and hydrate the incisions. The incisions were tested and found to be watertight with a Weck-cel sponge. The lid speculum and drapes were removed. Drops of prednisolone acetate and ofloxacin were instilled. A clear shield was taped over the eye and the patient was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.         ATTENDING STATEMENT    I personally performed all portions of the procedure.

Initially improved on flonase and singulair. Recently reccurring but currently improved.  Continue flonase, and singulair.  CXR normal; PFTs normal.  Has tried atrovent nasal spray and ICS with no improvement.  Patient is hesitant to go on neurontin b/c side effects which include drowsiness.  Repeat CXR without pathology.  Losartan withdrawal did not improve cough. Now with cough mostly at night, does not want to go back on antacid medication.  Has left sided throat tickling.  Does not want to pursue CT sinuses or ENT evaluation at this time since already underwent ENT eval/mgmt prior to coming to pulmonary.  To continue monitoring symptoms for now, would like to check in in 3 months over telephone and reconsider risk/benefit of trial of neurontin at that time.               "

Discussed HCPOA multiple times and they declined to complete. He and his wife have clear understanding of conversation with oncologist that further chemotherapy will cause more harm than benefit. Jene describes her strong faith and firm belief that Mr. Johnson has years to live despite stating understanding of the doctor's prognostication of months. She and Alfred ask that physicians stop discussing prognositication as they feel hearing bad news will negatively affect his health. We discussed hospice resources in detail, both Jene and Alfred adamantly decline hospice resources as they associate this with shortened lifespan. I attempted to explore this further and they became angry. They hope for home health nursing services and plan to go to Mercy hospital if his health declines while he is at home. They quickly refused discussion of CPR or limitations of any therapy and wish to remain Full Code.  Alfred and Jene were appreciative of expressions of continued supports and we will continue to follow, along with out chaplain, to provide them emotional support and discuss, as able, what resources we can get for them.

Continue scheduled ensure or other nutrition supplements  Hemorrhoidal pain: prior exam with external hemorrhoids, he reports no pain or bleeding, no wounds noted on recorded exams, deferred exam today.

He did not wish to continue mirtazapine and does not wish to trial SSRI.   Social Aspects of Care: Lives with wife in senior building where she also works as a CNA and can check on him frequently.   Spiritual Aspects of Care: reports strong faith, our team chaplain will follow for support  Cultural Aspects of Care: None affecting plan of care  Legal/Ethical Aspects of Care: Mr. Johnson names his wife Jene as surrogate decision maker. See palliative care note 12/12/18 for detailed discussion of goals of care, which have remained consistent with prior conversations in cilnic. They understand further cancer therapy will be more harm than benefit, perceive that Alfred has years to live despite recognition of doctors' prognostication of months, decline hospice serives. Per discussion with primary team they wish to be DNI however recieive other components of CPR. Attempted to explore and discuss limitations of this (particulary in setting of strong possiblity of respiratory arrest being a proximal cause for cardiac arrest) however he and his wife were not amenable to discussing. They decided this PM on placement at SAR. They stated previously they do not wish to further discuss prognosis and did not discuss in context of SAR. Given their declination of hospice, baseline prior functional status and potential for functional improvement which is their goal, agree that this is likely safest discharge plan.

Pt with tele chest port connected to IV. Ended session with pt in bed with HOB elevated, all lines intact, call light in reach, in NAD with all needs met, RN aware. Vital signs: VSS per EMR Pt report: Pt reports fatigue after participating in therapy on this date, 6/10 when asked to rate fatigue level. Pt agreed that he is deconditioned. Of note, pt's wife reports pt recently fell while at home, and reports the pt will not have 24hr assist available upon dc home.  Two patient identifiers confirmed.   Rehab Diagnosis: decreased independence with functional mobility, decreased endurance in the setting of B pulmonary lesions concerning for mets and severe emphysema Precautions: falls, bed alarm Home Situation: Pt lives with his wife who is a CNA in a senior building with elevator access. Denies DME at home. Wife not able to assist him 24/7. Pt reports he was able to walk to the bathroom without assistance prior to admission without an assistive device. Per wife's report in EMR, the pt has been spending most of his time in bed at home lately.  Procedural Interventions: Training in Functional Activity: Bed mobility: -Supine>sit, SBA with HOB elevated and bedrail use -Sit>supine, SBA -Scooting along EOB, SBA -Scooting supine in bed for repositioning, MAX A x2persons after pt attempted to perform independently with HOB flat  Transfers: -Sit>stand x2reps to RW, first attempt unsuccessful, second attempt successful with use of momentum -Stand>sit x2reps, CGA. Demos decreased eccentric lowering control  Gait training: -Amb ~40ft with RW, CGA. Demos decreased B step length/height, decreased cadence, thoracic kyphosis. VCs for pacing, energy conservation.  Therapeutic exercise: -B shoulder flexion AROM x20 -B bicep curls with 1# bottle x10 -B seated marches x20 -B LAQ x20 -B ankle pumps x20  Neuromuscular re-education: -Sitting EOB x10min total during session, SBA requiring up to CGA during times of lateral instability.

Pt with tele, chest port to IV. Ended session with pt in bed with HOB elevated, all lines intact, call light in reach, B SCDs donned, in NAD with all needs met.  Vital signs: VSS per EMR Pt report: Denies pain. Endorses 9/10 fatigue level after performing ambulation and ther ex on this date.   Two patient identifiers confirmed.   Rehab Diagnosis: decreased independence with functional mobility, decreased endurance in the setting of B pulmonary lesions concerning for mets and severe emphysema Precautions: falls, bed alarm Home Situation: Pt lives with his wife who is a CNA in a senior building with elevator access. Denies DME at home. Wife not able to assist him 24/7. Pt reports he was able to walk to the bathroom without assistance prior to admission without an assistive device. Per wife's report in EMR, the pt has been spending most of his time in bed at home lately.  Procedural Interventions: Training in Functional Activity: Bed mobility: -Supine>sit, MIN A for LE management and trunk movement. Performed with HOB elevated, increased time/effort -Sit>supine, MOD A for LE management. VCs for technique  Transfers: -Sit>stand x2reps to RW. MIN A x1rep, MOD A x1rep with multiple failed attempts at standing without physical assist. Demos difficulty initiating movement to lift bottom of bed -Stand>sit x2reps, MIN A. Demos poor eccentric lowering control  Gait training: -Amb ~45ft with RW, CGA. Demos decreased B step length/height likely due to increased B LE swelling, 3 instances of misstepping, increased steps to turn with mild instability, increased work of breathing. VCs for safety, energy conservation. -Amb laterally ~5ft via side stepping at EOB, RW, CGA.

Evidence for hyperinflation of the lungs. Mild bronchiectasis. Right retrocardiac opacity suspicious for pneumonia.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette demonstrates tortuous aorta.  No bony abnormalities are demonstrated.  IMPRESSION:  Right retrocardiac opacity suspicious for pneumonia.  12/13 EXAMINATION: Portable AP chest, single view  HISTORY:  fever   COMPARISON: CT 12/7/2018, radiograph 12/11/2018  FINDINGS: An AP portable view of the chest dated 12/13/2018 @ 0 150 is submitted for interpretation. Assessment of heart size is limited secondary to AP portable technique.  It is normal in size. The thoracic aorta is tortuous. Right chest port is identified. Its tip is probably in the right atrium. The lungs are hyperexpanded, consistent with COPD. Bullae are seen at the right apex. No focal airspace consolidation is evident. There is minimal scarring versus atelectasis at the right lung base.  IMPRESSION:  1. No convincing evidence of pneumonia.

Pt is a difficult historian; history obtained from him and his wife. Per wife, pt has been at or near his baseline recently. He has been struggling to maintain his weight, though appetite is still existant. He has been tired and in bed often, but this is not an acute change either. Last night, wife noticed that pt's lungs were """"rattling"""" more. """"It sounded like he had fluid in there."""" Denies known fevers at home. No nausea, vomiting, diarrea. Pt suffered a fall 1.5 weeks ago with trauma to head (has new scrape on forehead) but wife states that he has not had an AMS or neurologic concerns since this fall. Pt apparently recovered immediately after what was described as a mechanical fall (""""slipped on his robe"""").   onc info Diagnosis: T/ransverse colon adenocarcinoma Stage: cTxNxM1a, IVA Date of Diagnosis: 7/5/18 (per liver biopsy) Date of Initial Clinic Visit: 7/17/18 Date of Initially Chemotherapy Recommendation: 7/17/18 Chemotherapy Intent: palliative Treatment to date:  C1 FOLFIRI + Bev      9/5/18 C2 FOLFIRI + Bev      9/18/18 C3 FOLFIRI + Bev      10/2/18 C4 FOLFIRI (no bolus, 20% CIV dose reduction) + Bev  11/13/18   PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GEN - cachexic.

HPI:  Mr. Johnson dx at 57 years old man with no significant past medical history who presented with loosening of upper teeth and recurrent teeth infections. He was first evaluted in the oral-maxilla-facial surgery clinic on November 29, 2010, at which time on physical exam, he was found to have a submucosal mass centered in the right maxilla, involving the buccal plate, alveolus, hard palate. It crossed midline and involved the left maxilla. His right upper teeth were mobile, with a few missing left upper teeth. He also had palpable bilateral submandibular adenopathy. On November 30, 2010, he had biopsy of the maxilla lesion, which showed well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. On November 30, 2010, he had CT of the neck, which showed erosive mass involving the hard palate, anterior portion of the alveolar ridge. Superiorly it extended into the nsal septum and nasal ccavities with erosion of the medial wall of the maxilla sinus. Posteriorly it reached the soft palate. There were prominent lymph nodes on level 1 and 2 of the right neck. CT of the chest obtained on December 10, 2010 did not demonstrate metastatic disease. He is s/p R selective ND levels I-VI, L neck dissection, levels 1-3, and total maxillectomy on Dec 27th. Posterior margin was positive, so re-resection was done with negative posterior margin.

The patient is competent. The risks and                       benefits of the procedure and the sedation options and                       risks were discussed with the patient. All questions                       were answered and informed consent was obtained. Patient                       identification and proposed procedure were verified by                       the physician and the nurse in the procedure room.

ASA Grade                       Assessment: III - A patient with severe systemic                       disease. After reviewing the risks and benefits, the                       patient was deemed in satisfactory condition to undergo                       the procedure. The anesthesia plan was to use moderate                       sedation / analgesia (conscious sedation). Immediately                       prior to administration of medications, the patient was                       re-assessed for adequacy to receive sedatives. The heart                       rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturations, blood                       pressure, adequacy of pulmonary ventilation, and                       response to care were monitored throughout the                       procedure. The physical status of the patient was                       re-assessed after the procedure.                      After obtaining informed consent, the colonoscope was                       passed under direct vision. Throughout the procedure,                       the patient's blood pressure, pulse, and oxygen                       saturations were monitored continuously. The Colonoscope                       was introduced through the anus and advanced to the the                       cecum, identified by appendiceal orifice and ileocecal                       valve. The entire colon was examined. The colonoscopy                       was somewhat difficult due to a tortuous colon.                       Successful completion of the procedure was aided by                       applying abdominal pressure. The colonoscopy was                       somewhat difficult due to the patient's agitation.                       Successful completion of the procedure was aided by                       increasing the dose of sedation medication. The total                       duration of the procedure was 1 hour 7 minutes. Findings:      The perianal and digital rectal examinations were normal. Pertinent       negatives include normal sphincter tone.      Two semi-pedunculated polyps were found in the recto-sigmoid colon and       sigmoid colon. The polyps were 5 to 8 mm in size. These polyps were       removed with a cold snare. Resection and retrieval were complete.       Estimated blood loss was minimal.      A fungating non-obstructing large mass was found in the mid transverse       colon. The mass was partially circumferential (involving one-half of the       lumen circumference). The mass measured four cm in length. In addition,       its diameter measured fifteen mm. No bleeding was present. Four biopsies       were obtained with cold jumbo forceps for histology in the mid       transverse colon. Impression:          - Two 5 to 8 mm polyps at the recto-sigmoid colon and in                       the sigmoid colon, removed with a cold snare. Resected                       and retrieved.                      - Malignant tumor in the mid transverse colon.                      - Biopsies performed in the mid transverse colon. Recommendation:      - Discharge patient to home (ambulatory).                      - Resume previous diet indefinitely.                      - Continue present medications.                      - Await pathology results.                      - Return to Oncology as previously scheduled.

It crossed midline and involved the left maxilla. His right upper teeth were mobile, with a few missing left upper teeth. He also had palpable bilateral submandibular adenopathy. On November 30, 2010, he had biopsy of the maxilla lesion, which showed well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. On November 30, 2010, he had CT of the neck, which showed erosive mass involving the hard palate, anterior portion of the alveolar ridge. Superiorly it extended into the nsal septum and nasal ccavities with erosion of the medial wall of the maxilla sinus. Posteriorly it reached the soft palate. There were prominent lymph nodes on level 1 and 2 of the right neck. CT of the chest obtained on December 10, 2010 did not demonstrate metastatic disease. He is s/p R selective ND levels I-VI, L neck dissection, levels 1-3, and total maxillectomy on Dec 27th. Posterior margin was positive, so re-resection was done with negative posterior margin.

HPI:  Mr. Johnson dx at 57 years old man with no significant past medical history who presented with loosening of upper teeth and recurrent teeth infections. He was first evaluted in the oral-maxilla-facial surgery clinic on November 29, 2010, at which time on physical exam, he was found to have a submucosal mass centered in the right maxilla, involving the buccal plate, alveolus, hard palate. It crossed midline and involved the left maxilla. His right upper teeth were mobile, with a few missing left upper teeth. He also had palpable bilateral submandibular adenopathy. On November 30, 2010, he had biopsy of the maxilla lesion, which showed well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. On November 30, 2010, he had CT of the neck, which showed erosive mass involving the hard palate, anterior portion of the alveolar ridge. Superiorly it extended into the nsal septum and nasal ccavities with erosion of the medial wall of the maxilla sinus. Posteriorly it reached the soft palate. There were prominent lymph nodes on level 1 and 2 of the right neck. CT of the chest obtained on December 10, 2010 did not demonstrate metastatic disease. He is s/p R selective ND levels I-VI, L neck dissection, levels 1-3, and total maxillectomy on Dec 27th. Posterior margin was positive, so re-resection was done with negative posterior margin. Pathology consistent with bone invasion, so he was started on concurrent chemo + RT with cisplatin.  He received day 1 on 2/21/11. Day 22 was held due to low ANC at 1300.  WBC recovered and pt was given cisplatin on day 29 with Neulasta.  He completed RT 4/6/11. 7/2011 PET/CT negative.  Repeat PET/CT in 6/2012 negative as well.

CT Abd 6/25/18 IMPRESSION: 1.  Extensive bilateral hepatic lesions consistent with metastatic disease, significantly progressed from the comparison 4/26/2018 study. The largest lesion is within the right hepatic lobe and demonstrates interval enlargement. 2.  Resultant hepatomegaly causing inferomedial displacement of the gallbladder and inferior displacement of the pancreas. 3.  Mild intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary dilatation, more significant within the right hepatic lobe. There is also mild pancreatic ductal dilatation.  CT Neck 4/26/18 Impression: 1.  Stable extensive postsurgical changes relating to a maxillectomy and palatectomy with facial reconstruction. 2.  No new enhancing soft tissues to suggest tumor recurrence.  CT Chest 4/26/18 1.  Negative for intrathoracic metastasis. 2.  A new large heterogeneous lesion within the right hepatic lobe, highly suspicious for metastasis versus primary malignancy given patient's history. 3.  Diffuse bilateral centrilobular emphysema. 4.  A punctate right nonobstructing renal calculus. 5.  Persistent dilatation of the CBD.

Metastatic colon adenocarcinoma, MSI-Low - CT neck/chest in April 2018 that showed new liver lesions.  - CT Abd in June 2018 showed extensive bilateral hepatic lesions consistent with metastatic disease, the largest measuring 11.1 x 8.2 cm.  - Liver biopsy 7/5/18 confirmed metastatic colon adenocarcinoma, KRAS WT, BRAF WT, MSI-Low - Patient had been tolerating chemotherapy well but after C3 had decreased PO intake, denied dysphagia but had mucositis on exam. Discussed again that treatment is palliative and if it is causing him significant toxicity it may not be of benefit.  - D/C'd 5-FU bolus and dose reduce CIV by 20% with last cycle but still neutropenic today, ANC 1400. Will hold chemotherapy today. Continued weight loss may be 2/2 POD vs. chemotherapy. CEA has significantly decreased with treatment, however clinically patient is declining. Family not open to hospice or palliative care at this time. After discussion will repeat imaging and f/u after to discuss if they want to continue chemotherapy with further dose reduction or transition to hospice.  2. Symptom Management - Neutropenia: likely 2/2 chemotherapy, discussed neutropenic precautions, hold chemo as above   - Elevated alk phos: 2/2 liver involvement, no evidence of obstruction, improved - Mucositis: Patient denies but visible on exam, will reduce 5-FU further if chemotherapy is continued - Anemia: likely 2/2 bone marrow suppression from chemo, decreased from prior but no bleeding will monitor, would recommend transfusion to keep Hgb > 7 - Weight loss: may be 2/2 POD vs. decreased appetite from mucositis vs. weight loss, refused mirtazapine, weight stable, continue Ensure supplements       - Pain: Denies pain but had RUQ on exam, given Rx for Tramadol PRN - Psych: no s/s of depression, good support from family          - Tobacco Cessation: not smoking, quit in 2010           - Fertility Preservation: not interested  3.

She first noticed the lesion when she was overseas a couple of weeks ago, and thought it was a fungal infection.  She saw two dermatologists at an OSH who told her that they thought it was a callous and she underwent debridement for it. It started bleeding while she was overseas, and as soon as she came back to the USA, she went directly to Northwestern for further evaluation.  She underwent biopsy and an MRI there, but was not satisfied with the care, which is why she came here. She reports that they indicated that she may have angiosarcoma based off the pathology.  Regarding her functional status, patient is able to walk multiple blocks without chest pain or shortness of breath, and she is also able to climb two flights of stairs without issues.  She reports she has a history of infrequent palpitations for which she takes bisoprolol at home, but has not had palpitations recently (only gets them when she is very excited or anxious).  She reports she has had an extensive workup for these in the past, including 2-3 stress tests (most recent stress test 1.5 years ago at Lutheran General), and she reports the workup was unremarkable and stress tests were normal.

We discussed the nature of the lesion, as well as surgical and non surgical management options with the patient. Given the rapid onset and growth of the mass and the cytology concerning for possible angiosarcoma, we discussed that the best option would be to perform an excisional biopsy, which would constitute amputation of the left small toe and possible partial resection of the fifth metatarsal head. Should the excisional biopsy confirm the diagnosis of angiosarcoma, we discussed the need for additional surgical management, which would be further amputation through the foot or the ankle. The patient, as well as her husband and sons were counseled extensively on the probable diagnosis and all questiosn were answered. Risks, benefits and alternatives, including nonsurgical management were discussed. Risks include but are not limited to infection requiring IV antibiotics or return to the operating room, possible contamination of surrounding healthy tissue with neoplastic cells requiring return to the operating room for further amputation, as the treatment for angiosarcoma is typically wide surgical resection; there is also a risk of bleeding requiring transfusion or bleeding which may be life-threatening, damage to nerve, muscles, tendons, ligaments and bone, postoperative phantom pain or loss of function, postoprative numbness and tingling and medical complications including but not limited to heart attack, stroke, blood clots int he legs or in the lungs, pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient and her family voiced an understanding and wished to proceed.   Alexandra D'Agostini, PGY-3"

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Left small toe soft tissue mass.  TOURNIQUET TIME:  23 minutes.  IMPLANTS:  None.  COMPLICATIONS:  None.  ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  10 mL.  ATTENDING PHYSICIAN:  Yasser Farid, MD.  ASSISTANT PHYSICIANS:  Alexandra Joan D'Agostini, MD, PGY-3 and Amit Parekh, MD, PGY-1.  INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  Ms. Sultan is a 57-year-old female who presented to UIC with a soft tissue mass about the plantar surface of the left small toe.  She states she first noticed it approximately 2 weeks ago and it had grown in size such that it was fungating from her skin and was friable such that it was bleeding frequently.  The patient initially underwent excision in Pakistan and a second excision in Singapore, and despite this, the lesion continued to grow.  Options for management including non-operative versus operative management were discussed at length with the patient as well as her husband and children.  Ultimately, they wished to proceed with surgical intervention including a left small toe partial amputation.  DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  Ms. Sultan was met in the recovery room prior to her procedure where the history was reviewed with the patient as well as the consent.  The correct laterality of the surgery as well as correct surgical procedure were again verified with the patient and the left lower extremity was marked with the attending surgeon's initials.  The patient was then met by Anesthesia, where she did receive a regional block to the left lower extremity.  The patient was subsequently transferred from the recovery room to the operating room and transitioned to the operating table where she was placed supine on the operating table with a bump under the left lower extremity to internally rotate the left foot.  All bony prominences were padded.  The patient did receive sedation preoperatively.  The left lower extremity was then prepped in the usual sterile fashion and draped.  We did mark out our incision for our flaps on the dorsum of the left 5th toe as well as the volar aspect of the left small toe.  We then used a 15 blade scalpel to make our incision about the volar and dorsal aspect, taking care to create a flap for later closure.  We then continued our dissection down to bone cutting through the collateral ligaments on either side.  We did disarticulate the left 5th toe at the level of the proximal interphalangeal joint.  We did identify the neurovascular bundle on the medial side of the left 5th toe and did tie off the vessels to obtain adequate hemostasis.  We then used a rongeur to trim down the remaining distal end of the 5th toe proximal phalanx to ensure that the bony ends were smoothed out to allow for adequate closure without tension.  We then did take the flexor tendon from the plantar surface and tenodesis to surrounding soft tissue such that it would not retract more proximally into the foot and contaminate the surrounding structures should this mass be found to be malignant.  We then let down the tourniquet to ensure that we had adequate hemostasis, which again we worked on using electrocautery.  We then closed our skin flap using 3-0 nylon suture in a horizontal mattress fashion.  The skin did close up nicely without any tension or areas which had to be left open.  A sterile dressing was then applied to the left lower extremity including Xeroform, 4x4s, Kerlix, and Ace wrap.  The patient was then awoken from her sedation in stable condition.  She was transferred from the operating table to the gurney and transported back to the recovery room in stable condition prior to transfer to the 6th floor for continued care.  There were no complications.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and Dr. Farid was present for the entirety of the case.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Sultan is a 57-year-old female, who presented to UIC with a soft tissue mass about the plantar surface of the left small toe.  She states she 1st noticed it approximately 3 weeks ago and had grown in size fairly quickly to the point that it was fungating from her skin and was free of all such that it was bleeding frequently.  The patient initially underwent excision in Pakistan and a 2nd excision in Singapore and despite this, the lesion continued to grow.  We had discussed the likelihood of malignancy of this mass based on its rate to growth and options for management, which included nonoperative versus operative.  Ultimately, the patient had wished to proceed with surgical intervention including a left small toe partial amputation.  The patient returns approximately 1 week postop.  She reports that her pain has been fairly controlled, although she does report some nerve pain.  She also reports pain primarily with use of her boot.  The patient has a PET scan scheduled for next week as well as an additional clinic appointment with Dr. Farid next week to follow up on the status of her biopsy, which is currently pending as well as the results of her PET scan, which she will have prior to her appointment next week.  She is here today for a postop wound check.  She has no other complaints or concerns at this time.  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  A 10-point review of systems was performed and negative except as per HPI.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is alert and oriented x3, in no acute distress.  Nonlabored respirations.  Equal chest wall rise bilaterally.  Well- perfused extremities.  Nondistended abdomen.  On examination of the left lower extremity mass, the patient has a dressing in place which was removed revealing an incision over the distal left toe, which is clean, dry, and intact with sutures in place.  Very minimal surrounding erythema and swelling likely postoperative in nature.  No fluctuance.  No drainage.  No other signs of infection.  The patient is able to wiggle her toes and has sensation intact to light touch globally throughout the foot.  She also has well-perfused foot with brisk capillary refill.  ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Ms. Sultan is a 57-year-old female, status post the above procedure, now 1 week postop.  She appears to be doing well aside from difficulty and pain with ambulation in the boot.  She already has her appointment for both the PET scan as well as a clinic appointment with Dr. Farid next week to discuss the results of her biopsy as well as a PET scan. At this time, she has no other complaints.  Given her pain, we will prescribe the patient some gabapentin.  Furthermore, some of the patient's sutures were removed today in clinic and there are still some residual sutures in place. The patient had multiple questions today including questions about previous MRIs, her 3rd toe mass, as well as the results of her pathology.  All of her questions were answered.  The patient understood and agreed with the plan. There were no barriers to communication.  Dr. Farid formulated the above plan and agrees with the assessment.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 57-year-old female, status post the above-stated procedure performed on November 14, 2018.  Final pathology from the procedure indicated angiosarcoma with positive resection margins.  In clinic today, the patient is doing well, ambulating with a cane.  She denies any wound complications including redness or drainage from the wound.  The patient states she is unsure if she wants to undergo additional surgery despite her conversations at previous clinic visits.  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  A 12-point review of systems was performed and negative except as noted in the HPI.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Alert and oriented x3.  No acute distress.  Nonlabored respirations.  Extremities well perfused.  No visible rashes.  Normal mood and affect.  Left foot exam with well-healing incision status post small toe amputation.  No erythema, induration, or purulence noted.  Sensation intact to light touch, saphenous, sural, tibial, and peroneal distributions.  2+ DP pulse.  Brisk cap refill to toes.  ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient is a 57-year-old female, here for followup of angiosarcoma of the left small toe status post amputation.  We explained that the margins were positive from her biopsy indicating that she has additional angiosarcoma cells still remaining in her foot that will likely progress to recurrence of tumor if not treated with wider excision.  The patient understands that recurrence of tumor would likely require that she undergo a more proximal amputation of her lower extremity.  We recommend a left 5th ray resection with bone biopsy.  The patient is unsure if she would like to proceed with surgery and would like some more time to think about it. We discussed the risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgery and the patient signed a written consent for tentative OR date of December 26, 2018.  She will call the clinic to cancel should she change her mind.  The patient expressed understanding of her assessment and plan and all questions were answered.  The patient was also seen and evaluated by Dr. Farid who agreed with the assessment and plan.

We did hand them in to Dr Ale who later informed that UIC pathologists were in agreement with the NW pathologistsÂ¿ suspicion of Angio Sarcoma. I never saw any formal report from UIC though.  Accordingly, request that you please assist with coordinating with the Pathology Dept to provide a copy of the report or have them upload the same on the UIC patient portal. As a matter of fact, not even the final diagnosis of tissue biopsy of the amputated toe has so far been uploaded though weÂ¿ve got it through the courtesy of yourself as well as the Pathology Dept.

She was seen by an urgent care center and radiographic studies were obtained, which were basically normal.  She was told that she had a cyst in the back of her knee.  They did not do a Doppler study to rule out a blood clot.  She has not had dependent swelling, however, it did start after extended driving for 10 hours.  She did not take any oral contraceptives and has no other history related to a blood clot.  Nonetheless, I am still concerned about that.  She does have a small soft tissue swelling posteriorly, nothing dependent in the legs.  Pulses and flow appears to be intact distally.  PLAN:  At this point, we are going to get an urgent Doppler study to rule out the presence of a blood clot or confirm the diagnosis of Baker cyst.  Assuming the answer is no blood clot, we will place her on a course of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories and physical therapy and have her follow back up in this clinic in about 4 weeks to make sure she has continued to do well.  If it is positive, we would have her referred to Medicine for treatment of her DVT.  In the meantime, we will monitor her progress.  If it is negative, would try the physical therapy and nonsteroidals.  If she returns at that point with a negative Doppler study, would probably consider getting an MRI scan looking for intraarticular pathology that might be addressed related to her meniscus that might be leading to this Baker cyst.

He was previously provided information on this trial and today reports that he does not wish to be included in this trial.     Patient completed xT, xF Tempus testing and consent today to assess for actionable mutations. Will order xG    RTC in 1 month for labs and March 2022 for GnRH and follow up.    2) Pain: none currently    3) Bone Health:   - Continue to take supplemental Ca/Vit D  - DEXA scan ordered  - s/p dentist appointment and cleaning    4) Metabolic: Based on patients medical history, cancer and treatment he is at risk. He will follow up regularly with his  PCP.    5) Cancer Risk: reviewed the role of germline genomic profiling given his de novo metastatic disease. Tempus testing and consent completed today.   Indication for Germline Genetic Testing:   The patient's personal and or family history meet the newest NCCN criteria for genetic testing for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) syndrome based on his own diagnosis of prostate cancer with a Gleason score equal or greater than 7. Per most recently NCCN guidelines related to prostate cancer """"Germline genetic testing is recommended for all men with high-risk, very high risk, regional, or metastatic prostate cancer.""""     Pre-Test Counseling:   It was discussed with the patient that hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome(HBOC) is considered in patients and or families with multiple cases of breast, ovarian, advanced prostate, and other related cancers, often diagnosed at younger ages than are typical for these types of cancer.  Mutations in two genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, account for the majority of all HBOC. Overall inherited mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are relatively rare, accounting for approximately 5-10% of all breast or prostate cancer diagnoses. The lifetime risk for males with HBOC include risks for  male breast cancer up to 8%, and prostate cancer of approximately 20% and some increased risk for melanoma and pancreatic cancers depending on which gene a mutation is found it.     We also briefly discussed Lynch syndrome, an autosomal dominant cancer susceptibility syndrome, that is associated with increased risks for colorectal (40-80%), endometrial (25-60%), ovarian (4-24%), urinary tract (1-4%) or additional GI and prostate cancers. Common synonyms for Lynch syndrome include HNPCC (hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer) and Muir-Torre syndrome  Lynch syndrome can be caused by mutations in several genes, including MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and EPCAM (Mismatch Repair genes).    We reviewed that  BRCA, Lynch syndrome and most other cancer risks gene mutations are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, and thus siblings, offspring, and other relatives of an affected individual have up to a 50% risk of inheriting the familial mutation. Therefore we discussed that germline genetics testing for the patient may have significant cancer risk indications for their family members as well as themselves.    It was discussed with the patient that pending the results of this testing should he return positive it would directly impact both he and his family members guideline recommended prostate, breast, colon, ovarian or other cancer risk screening. For himself we briefly discussed that a mutation in an HBOC or MMR genes may lead to the availability of certain targeted treatment trails that he could discuss with his urology team. The patient agreed that should he be positive for one of the treatment related genes he would very much like to pursue this increased care and enter any applicable trials.     The pros, cons, and limitations of genetic testing were discussed, including the potential implications of test results (+, -, VUS) on clinical management. With regard to the significant possibility of Variants of Uncertain Significance(VUSs) being returned on the patient's testing results we discussed with the patient that since supporting evidence is limited on the clinical significance of VUSs at this time, it is not recommended that they be used for any clinical management decisions or testing for the patient or their family. The hope is that overtime additional research will be identified to reclassify these variant and that our team will recontact the patient when this occurs. We also discussed the possibility in panel genetic test that we could find, incidental findings; genetic diagnoses that are not expected based on their personal or family history. The patient expressed that they understood this and will be  referred to our Genetic Counseling team per any positive results or genetics diagnoses found.    After completion of genetic counseling session today, patient desired to proceed with pancancer xG panel testing through the Tempus(molecular studies completed by GeneDx). The patient was consented and buccal swab was collected and sent to Tempus.  Germline xG panel testing pursued today include 52 genes; APC, ATM, AXIN2, BAP1, BARD1, BLM, BMPR1A, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDH1, CDK4, CDKN2A, CHEK2, EPCAM, FANCC, FANCM, FH, FLCN, GALNT12, GREM1*, HOXB12, MET, MLH1, MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, MUTYH, NBN, NF1, PALB2, PMS2, POLD1, POLE, POT1, PTEN, RAD51C, RAD51D, RECQL4, RNF43, RPS20, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SMAD4, STK11, TP53, TSC1, TSC2, and VHL.    Paperwork was completed and signed by the patient today for Tempus' financial assistance program related to any somatic or germline genetic testing pursued through Tempus.     The patient asked that he be provided with his results during another appointment if possible or by phone if this is not possible. Patient agreed to a follow up consult with Genetic Counseling team should his results return positive. He was given an opportunity to ask questions, all patient questions were answered to his satisfaction, and he verbalized understanding of the plan as outlined. No communication barriers were identified.

These may be further evaluated with CT versus radiograph .     The following terms      Bone mineral density: DEXA pending    Independent interpretation of tests (indicate test and interpretation): Reviewed imaging and pathology consistent with metastatic prostate cancer    ADDITIONAL DATA REVIEWED AND/OR  DISCUSSED:  1) Review or prior external notes or records (type of record and content reviewed):  n/a    2) Assessment requiring independent historian other than patient (indicate history and from whom):  Sister Odessa via phone    3) Discussion of management or test with another health care provider (indicate what was discussed and with whom):  Dr. Moreira    ASSESSMENT & PLAN     PROBLEM LIST    1) Metastatic Prostate Cancer: high burden, de novo disease. Suspect castrate-sensitive disease.   - Initiated on GHRHa. Will obtain testosterone but note this is after GHRHa initiation.   Â¿Â¿  We reviewed the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment goals of metastatic prostate cancer. We also reviewed the rationale for ADT and the toxicities of this therapy including, but not limited to: hot flashes; injection site reactions; loss of sexual interest; gynecomastia/breast tenderness; weight changes; and increased risk of DM, MI, and CVA.  We will check blood glucose and a lipid panel at a minimum of once yearly to screen for these toxicities.  A bone mineral density test will be conducted every two years to evaluate for bone loss.    Â¿Â¿  We also reviewed the role of ADT in combination with either 1) second generation ARSI (abiraterone/pred, apalutamide, enzalutamide) vs. 2) docetaxel. Toxicities of docetaxel including N/V/D, fatigue, neuropathy, hair loss among others were discussed. Toxicities of 2nd gen ARSI, specifically abiraterone/prednisone including HTN, hyperglycemia, LFT or electrolyte abnormalities were reviewed.   Â¿Â¿  After discussion, Mr. Lee prefers to avoid chemotherapy for now.   We will initiate insurance authorization for abiraterone. Will refer ADEs with opthomolagy and confirm he is closely monitored.  Two weeks after abiraterone is received he will return for labs and toxicity check.   Â¿Â¿  We discussed that he is eligible for enrollment to our trial S1802: Phase III Randomized Trial of SST vs. SST + Definitive  Treatment of the Primary tumor in Metastatic Prostate Cancer. He was previously provided information on this trial and wishes to continue to discuss this with his family.     2) Pain: none currently     3) Bone Health:   - Ca/Vit D  - DEXA scan ordered  - referral for dentist placed    4) Metabolic: Based on patients medical history, cancer and treatment he is at risk. He will follow up regularly with his PCP.    5) Cancer Risk: reviewed the role of germline genomic profiling given his de novo metastatic disease. Will order germline panel with Tempus today.    Next Follow up: 2 weeks with labs and for toxicity check  Referrals: n/a    Orders Placed This Encounter   Procedures   Â¿Â¿Â¿ Comprehensive metabolic panel   Â¿Â¿Â¿ CBC and differential   Â¿Â¿Â¿ Comprehensive metabolic panel   Â¿Â¿Â¿ Magnesium   Â¿Â¿Â¿ PSA   Â¿Â¿Â¿ Hepatic function panel   Â¿Â¿Â¿ TEMPUS - Miscellaneous Test   Â¿Â¿Â¿ Testosterone     Attending Physician Attestation  On 9/10/2021 I spent 60 minutes reviewing records as part of the evaluation and in face-to-face counseling with the patient on the diagnosis of metastatic prostate cancer and the recommended treatment plan.

The prostate and seminal vesicles were evaluated using ultrasound. The ultrasound was used to measure the diameters of the prostate in the transverse and sagittal planes in order to compute the prostate volume using the ellipsoid formula (see below). The ultrasound was used to guide a 20-gauge spinal needle to the angle between the seminal vesicle and prostatic base bilaterally in order to inject 5 cc of 1% plain Lidocaine for local anesthesia. An 18-gauge biopsy gun was then guided by transrectal ultrasound to perform prostatic core biopsies as below. Once the biopsies were completed, the ultrasound probe was removed from the rectum.    Findings:  Prostate measurement:  Height: 43 mm  Length: 39 mm  Width: 50 mm    Prostate volume: 43.9 cc   PSA Density: 2.16 mg/dL/cc  Number of cores samples: 12  Location of Cores Taken:   Left: Apex, Mid and Base  Right: Apex, Mid and Base  Findings: Calcifications  Complications: None    Plan:  Disposition: Return to clinic in 2 weeks.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Visually significant cataract, left eye. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Cataract extraction by phacoemulsification with placement of posterior chamber intraocular lens; Anterior vitrectomy; Scleral-sutured Ahmed segment, left eye LENS IMPLANT: MA60AC 22.5 D, left eye RESIDENT SURGEON: Wyatt Messenger, MD ATTENDING SURGEON: Elmer Tu, MD ANESTHESIA: Retrobulbar Marcaine C, Monitored anesthesia care with topical. COMPLICATIONS: None. INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: This is a 62-year-old patient complaining of painless progressive loss of the left eye. Preoperatively, the patient was found to have a visually significant cataract of the left eye as well as vitreous in the AC. The risks, benefits and alternatives were discussed at length with the patient; including the increased risk of needing a second surgery. Informed consent was obtained. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  On the day of surgery, the patient was brought to the preoperative holding area. The left eye was marked and confirmed to be the appropriate operative site. The patient was brought to the operating suite and placed in the supine position. Topical tetracaine and lidocaine jelly was instilled on the eye for anesthesia. A retrobulbar injection of 5 mL Marcaine C was injected. The eye was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner for ophthalmic surgery. A Lieberman lid speculum was used to provide exposure of the eye. A side port blade were used to create a paracentesis. Epi-Shugarcaine was injected into the paracentesis followed by an air bubble and trypan blue to stain the anterior lens capsule. BSS was used to irrigate the anterior chamber. Vitreous was noted to be coming forward under the temporal iris. Viscoat was injected to form the anterior chamber and the 2.4 mm micro-keratome blade was used to create a full-thickness biplanar clear corneal incision. The cystotome needle was used to create the capsulorrhexis flap and the Utrata forceps were used to create a continuous curvilinear capsulorrhexis. More viscoelastic was used to keep the vitreous posterior. Next, anterior vitrectomy was performed with attention to the termporal iris. BSS on a hydrodissection cannula was used to perform gentle hydrodissection. The lens was delivered into the the anterior chamber. Given the capsular weakness, it was determined to not be safe to reposition it into the capsular bag and was left in the anterior chamber. Phacoemulsification was begun to remove the nucleus. The entire nucleus and most of the cortex was removed with a combination of phacoemulsification and aspiration while the second instrument was positioned posteriorly to protect the capsule. After near complete removal of the lens material, approximately 6 clock hours of zonular weakness was noted inferotemporally; however, the bag could be completely inflated with Provisc without any signs of capsular tear. Next, a 2x2 mm peritomy was created in the temporal conjunctiva and cautery was used to blanch any bleeding vessels. Then, the middle islet of a 6E Ahmed segment was threaded with a 10-0 prolene, double-armed suture outside the eye. A bent 25 gauge needle was passed 2.5 mm posterior to the limbus. The curved needle attached to the prolene suture was passed through the main wound and threaded into the 25 gauge needle. The prolene suture was externalized. Next, the same technique was used to externalize the other end of the 10-0 nylon suture. The Ahmed segment was successfully positioned with the segment in the bag and the middle islet just anterior to the anterior capsule. The prolene sutures were tied which centered the capsular bag complex. Next, irrigation and aspiration was used to remove the remaining cortical material. Provisc was injected into the capsular bag and a MA60AC lens was injected into the capsular bag.The irrigation/aspiration was used to remove the remaining viscoelastic material. A cotton-tip applacator was used to confirm the absence of vitreous at the wounds. Balanced salt solution (BSS) on a 30-gauge cannula was used to hydrate the incisions. The incisions were found to be watertight. The eye had adequate pressure. The lens remained centered. The conjunctiva at the site of the externalized sutures was closed with three 8-0 Vicryl sutures. Ancef was injected in the subconjunctival space. The speculum and drapes were removed. The patient received several sets of prednisolone acetate, ketorolac, and polytrim drops. The eye was patched and shielded and the patient was brought to the recovery room in good condition having tolerated the procedure well. Dr. Tu was present for the entire procedure."

Pt was transferred from an OSF to  UIC on 1/12 for concern of chest pain.  Stress at OSH reportedly showed peri-infarct ischemia. LHC was repeated on 1/13 and revealed patent stents and stable CAD. She had several episodes of chest pain during her admission.  Pain initially improved with NG, but this also made her transiently hypotensive and nauseated.  She was started on 650mg aspirin bid prn to treat presumed post-infarct pericarditis. This provided good pain relief and pt was discharged 1/14/16.

Rationale:  MDM: Pt w/known significant CV hx presenting with substernal CP. Pt took 1 SL nitro in the ED and chest pain went from 5/10 to 0/10. VSS stable currently. EKG concerning for T-wave flattening in lateral leads and new PACs/arrhythmia which was not preesent previously. Pt does have worsening of her previous dx of hyponatremia (likely 2/2 topoor  oral intake) at 121 w/no neurologic dysfxn and leukopenia. Called CCU resident who agreed to accept pt onto their service for evaluation of ACS, hyponatremia and leukopenia. Pt got 3more baby ASA as she took 1 at home this AM. Troponin negative, CXR clear. Stable for admission to Tele under cardiology service.    .  Electrocardiogram:  Sinus arrhythmia w/multiple PACS, T wave flattening in V4-V6 compared to previous from several weeks ago. .

Also acknowledge nutrition consult for poor PO and weight loss. Attempted to follow up with pt multiple times this afternoon however she has been unavailable. Per review of EMR pt appears to have had 1 episode of nausea associated with chest pain PTA. Since admit pt has been NPO -- pt is currently NPO for possible heart cath. Weight history was reviewed in EMR in which a 10% weight loss was noted in EMR. Weight loss would be considered severe if accurate. Presence of muscle wasting could not be assessed at this time. No edema was noted in per RN documentation. Agree with current diet order. Oral supplement order for Ensure Enlive TID. Each supplement provides 350 kcals and 20g PRO. Labs were reviewed and noted above. Albumin is not a good marker of nutritional status. Severe weight loss is concerning for malnutrition.

CAD as described above; no interval change from 12/23/2015 2. Widely patent RCA stents  Nuclear Stress 7/21/2016 TECHNIQUE: Multiple planar and tomographic images of the left ventricle were obtained 30 minutes post injection of 13.9 mCi Tc-99m tetrofosmin.  The patient was then transported to the cardiology laboratory and infused with 0.4 mg of Regadenoson which was followed with an injection of 24.55 mCi Tc-99m tetrofosmin. 1 minute postinfusion patient became hypotensive with blood pressures 80's/60's with bradycardia into the 40's and became unresponsive. 50 mg of Aminophylline administered for symptoms and within 1 minute of onset heart rate and blood pressure returned near baseline and patient became responsive. Patient was monitored for an additional 20 minutes and remained stable. Patient returned to the nuclear medicine laboratory for planar and SPECT imaging of the left ventricle.  Both rest and post pharmacologic stress images were compared.  COMPARISON: None  FINDINGS OF MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION IMAGES:  LEFT VENTRICULAR CHAMBER SIZE:  Normal  PERFUSION REST AND STRESS :           LV:                           No abnormal tracer uptake. Mild decreased tracer uptake in the inferior wall, with similar pattern on both rest and stress images, nearly completely reversed on attenuation corrected images, consistent with diaphragmatic attenuation artifact. Mild decreased tracer uptake in apical region on both rest and stress images, is consistent with physiological apical thinning.  GATED STUDY:  Done 30 minutes post stress  Demonstrates mild dyskinetic wall motion  LV EJECTION FRACTION:  50-55% on visual assessment  IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of stress induced ischemia. 2. Normal left ventricular chamber size with mild dyskinetic wall motion. 3. Normal LVEF 50-55% on visual assessment.  NOTE:  EKG interpretation can be found under Exercise/Stress Procedure notes.     This study was reviewed and interpreted with Dr. Lu and dictated by Dr. Michael Kim.

I discussed the case with the renal team during rounds. I reviewed and agree with this note. Mrs. Jenkins is a 75 y-o African American woman who is in the hospital due to chest pain. The renal service was consulted for evaluation of hyponatremia (~120 mEq/L). Physical exam revealed orthostatic hypotension. Urine osmolality was 258 mOsm/L, greater than serum osmolality, indicating the presence of anti-diuretic hormone attempting to restore intravascular volume. This acute component of hyponatremia has improved with intravascular volume resuscitation in the form of intravenous isotonic fluid boluses (acute kidney injury has also improved with intravascular volumen resuscitation suggeting a pre-renal cause). Reviewing her serum sodium trend, it is apparent that she has chronic hyponatremia. She endorses use of HCTZ 25 mg/day for many years (even though it is not listed under her medication records). Thiazide diuretics are often cause of hyponatremia, specially in elderly individuals; therefore, this medication should be discontinued. However, in the presence of weight loss and smoking history, a malignancy work up is warranted (malignancy causing SIADH). This was discussed with the patient. Once her volume status is normal, if she continues to be hyponatremic, her daily water intake allowance will depend on the amount of free water excreted by her kidneys (please continue to quantify urine output and repeat urine sodium, potassium and osmolality concomitantly with serum sodium). Thank you for this consult, we will continue to monitor closely.  Ana C. Ricardo, MD Nephrology attending Office 312-996-8392 Fax 312-996-7378 Page 312-996-2242 ID# 9653"

Patient's mental status improved rapidly and patient reported feeling 'much better'.  Vital signs remained stable post infusion of aminophylline.  Per OSH information, patient has documented hyponatremia as far back as 2013.  Since establishing care at UIH in 2015, highest recorded Na value of 131 with baseline in the 120's.  Of note, she reports having taken HCTZ for years. Nephrology consulted to assist in work-up.    vitals revealed orthostatic hypotension. Urine osmolality was 258 mOsm/L, greater than serum osmolality, indicating the presence of anti-diuretic hormone attempting to restore intravascular volume. This acute component of hyponatremia improved with intravascular volume resuscitation in the form of intravenous isotonic fluid boluses (acute kidney injury also improved with intravascular volume resuscitation suggesting a pre-renal cause)  However, patient reports anorexia for the past few months with twenty pound weight loss over 3 months, as well as being extra thirsty the past 7 months or so.    In the presence of weight loss and smoking history, a malignancy work up is warranted (malignancy causing SIADH).  This had been initiated prior to hospitalization by Ms. Jenkins' PCP.
