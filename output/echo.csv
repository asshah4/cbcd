The tricuspid regurgitant velocity is 3.03 m/s, and with an assumed right atrial pressure of 15 mmHg, the estimated right ventricular systolic pressure is moderately elevated at 51.8 mmHg. Pulmonic Valve: Mild pulmonic valve regurgitation. The pulmonic valve is not well seen. Pericardium: There is a trivial pericardial effusion. Aorta: The aortic sinuses and root appear normal. Venous: IVC size is dilated with <50% collapse consistent with an RA pressure of 15 - 20 mmHg.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CONCLUSIONS:  1. The left ventricular cavity size is mildly increased.  2. Normal left ventricular function.  3. LV ejection fraction is visually estimated to be 60 to 65%.  4. Diastolic dysfunction consistent with abnormal LV relaxation with increased LAP.  5. Severely dilated left atrium.  6. Moderately dilated right atrium.  7. Aortic valve appears moderately sclerotic. Vmax 2.4 m/sec; Peak gradient 22 mm Hg; Mean gradient 11 mm Hg, DI 0.8 AVA by continuity assuming an LVOT diameter of 1.93 cm is > 2 cm sq. This gradient is borderline for aortic stenosis and may reflect high output or anemia.  8. Mild thickening/calcification of the mitral anterior and posterior leaflets. Mild mitral annular calcification.  9. Moderately elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure. ____________________________ B11A Joan Briller M.D. Electronically signed on: 12/14/2020 8:00:47 PM   *** Final ***

Right Ventricle: The right ventricular size is normal. Global RV systolic function is low normal. Left Atrium: The left atrium is mildly to moderately dilated. Left Ventricle: The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Ventricular wall thickness is mildly increased. There is normal global left ventricular function. Overall left ventricular ejection fraction by visual estimate is 55%. Mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. Left ventricular regional function is normal. Doppler exam is indeterminate. Aortic Valve: No indication of aortic valve regurgitation. The aortic valve is trileaflet; normal. No aortic stenosis. Mitral Valve: Trivial mitral valve regurgitation. The mitral valve is normal. Tricuspid Valve: Trivial tricuspid valve regurgitation is present. The tricuspid valve structure is normal.

LV ejection fraction is visually estimated to be 55 to 60%. LVEF quantification challenging due to variable R-R intervals.  5. Normal right ventricular size with low-normal systolic function. Normal pulmonary artery systolic pressure; 27 mm Hg.  6. No hemodynamically significant valve disease.  7. Inferior vena cava findings consistent with normal right atrial pressure.  8. Compared to prior study 5/14/2019, septal hypokinesis appears improved, though beat-to-beat variation in LV function limits precise regional wall motion assessment today. ____________________________ TU09 Hema Krishna M.D. Electronically signed on: 3/24/2022 7:50:19 PM   *** Final ***

Right Ventricle: The right ventricular size is mildly enlarged. Global RV systolic function is normal. Left Atrium: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left Ventricle: The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Ventricular wall thickness is mildly increased. There is global normal left ventricular function. Overall left ventricular ejection fraction by visual estimate is 60%. Doppler exam shows restrictive filling consistent with abnormal ventricular relaxation, increased left atrial pressure, and elevated left ventricular end diastolic pressure. Aortic Valve: Trace aortic valve regurgitation. A bioprosthesis (by history TAVR) is noted in the aortic positon. No significant perivalvular insufficiency is identified. Vmax 3.6 m/sec Peak gradient 50 mm Hg, Mean gradient 33 mm Hg; DI 0.53; LVOT Vmax 2 m/sec therefore likely measured too close to the valve and not reliable. Mitral Valve: Mild mitral valve regurgitation. No evidence of mitral valve stenosis. A bioprosthesis is present in the mitral position. Mean transmitral diastolic gradient is 2 mm Hg at a heart rate of 74 bpm. MVA by T 1/2 is > 3 cm sq which does not suggest significant prosthetic stenosis. A large mobile echodensity is noted in multiple views in the left atrium which appears to be attached to the anterior portion of the prosthesis. Differential diagnosis includes vegetations versus thrombus. The mitral regurgitation may be periprosthetic and represent a perforation.There is also the suggestion of mild transprosthetic mitral regurgitation. Tricuspid Valve: Mild-moderate tricuspid valve regurgitation is present. The tricuspid valve structure is normal. The tricuspid regurgitant velocity is 2.73 m/s, and with an assumed right atrial pressure of 8 mmHg, the estimated right ventricular systolic pressure is mildly elevated at 37.8 mmHg.

General Comments: Leads are noted in the right atrium and ventricle.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CONCLUSIONS:  1. Normal left ventricular function.  2. LV ejection fraction is visually estimated to be 60 to 65%.  3. Diastolic dysfunction consistent with abnormal LV relaxation, elevated LAP, and elevated LVEDP.  4. Mildly enlarged right ventricle.  5. Moderately dilated left atrium.  6. Moderately dilated right atrium.  7. The mitral valve is mildly thickened and calcified. Mean transmitral diastolic gradient is 2 mm Hg at a heart rate of 74 bpm.

A large mobile echodensity is noted in multiple views in the left atrium which appears to be attached to the anterior portion of the prosthesis. Differential diagnosis includes vegetation versus thrombus. Artifact is unlikely. The mitral regurgitation suggests a perforation in addition to transvalvular insufficiency  8. A bioprosthesis is noted in the aortic positon. No significant perivalvular insufficiency is identified. Vmax 3.6 m/sec Peak gradient 50 mm Hg, Mean gradient 33 mm Hg; DI 0.53; LVOT Vmax 2 m/sec therefore likely measured too close to the valve and not reliable. AT is <100 msec.

Venous: IVC size is dilated with >50% collapse consistent with an RA pressure of 10 - 15 mmHg. General Comments: Linear echodensity seen extending into right ventricle likely represents EP device lead.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CONCLUSIONS:  1. The left ventricular cavity size is mildly increased.  2. Low normal left ventricular function.  3. LV ejection fraction is visually estimated to be 50 to 55%.  4. Moderate to severe aortic stenosis with a mean AV gradient of 25.4 mmHg, peak AV velocity of 3.30 m/s and valve area of 0.70 cm¿¿¿¿. Change in calculated valve area likely due to an understimate of LVOT VTI, as all other parameters are similar to previous study of 8/19/2019.  5. Aortic valve is not well seen but is probably bicuspid.  6. Moderately elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure. ____________________________ X28S Christopher P Gans M.D. Electronically signed on: 10/20/2020 3:28:11 PM *** Final ***

The tricuspid regurgitant velocity is 2.19 m/s, and with an assumed right atrial pressure of 3 mmHg, the estimated right ventricular systolic pressure is normal at 22.1 mmHg. Pulmonic Valve: Trace pulmonic valve regurgitation. The pulmonic valve is normal. Pericardium: There is no pericardial effusion. Aorta: The aortic sinuses and root appear normal. Not well seen. Venous: IVC size is normal consistent with normal RA pressure.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CONCLUSIONS:  1. Normal left ventricular function.  2. LV ejection fraction is visually estimated to be 60 to 65%.  3. Mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy.  4. Severely dilated left atrium.  5. Moderate aortic valve regurgitation. There is focal calcification of the commissure of the right and noncoronary leaflets of the aortic valve. Peak velocity of 1.8 m/s, mean gradient of 7 mm Hg and peak gradient of 13 mm Hg do not suggest significant stenosis.  6. Mildly decreased mitral posterior leaflet mobility. There is focal calcification at the base of the posterior mitral leaflet which also involves the mitral annulus. Mean gradient of 1-2 mm Hg at heart rate of 89 bpm does not suggest stenosis. Pressure half time of 82 msec consistent with normal valve orifice of 2.7 cm2.  7. Mild thickening/calcification of the mitral anterior and posterior leaflets. ____________________________ X28S Christopher P Gans M.D. Electronically signed on: 3/25/2021 2:23:54 PM   *** Final ***

LV ejection fraction is visually estimated to be 60 to 65%.  3. Right ventricle not well seen. Global RV systolic function is normal.  4. Valve not well seen but appear to be grossly normal and no clear significant valvular regurgitation.  5.
